              ((1)) Sarapias to Ammonios her father and lord, many greetings. I constantly
                     pray that you are well, and I make obeisance on your behalf before
                     Philotera. I left Myos Hormos quickly after giving birth. I have taken
                     nothing from Myos Hormos. ((6)) Recently I sent from Myos Hormos 4 drachmas
                     in order that you bring me slices. Send me 1 small drinking cup … and
                     send your daughter a small pillow. I have received 2 small loaves of bread. I
                     pray for your health.
