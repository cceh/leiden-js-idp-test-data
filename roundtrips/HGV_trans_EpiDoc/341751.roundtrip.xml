                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Adrastos to his father Theon, greetings. You will do well, when you are in Antinoou Polis with Sarapion, to meet also Rufus, the prefect's friend.
<milestone unit="line" n="6"/> For he willingly promised to help you in whatever is needed; do not hesitate, however, to use your own capacity in order to achieve everything;
for the journey to Antinoou Polis does not take you many days. <milestone unit="line" n="13"/> I asked Sarapion to help you in order to get on my behalf two mantles and a double cloak, 
all of them white, which in any case should be (â€¦) for me before the upstream delivery.
<milestone unit="line" n="18" rend="break"/> Let there be no hindrance on any account either by your hesitation - for Sarapion will help - or because of the price of the woof: at whatever price,
let it be bought; and the money I shall pay here to his father. I pray that you be well, my respected father Theon.
               </p>
