                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Dioskourides, hegemon and garrison commander, from Iason and Petalos, those in charge of the 
                   tax on hides in the Herakleopolite nome in year 35. <milestone unit="line" n="7" rend="break"/>On the 21st of Choiach, after discovering 9 donkey hides, we handed them 
                   over to Apollonios and Epimachos, your agents; and to you, we handed over Didymos, the man who had smuggled them. 
                   <milestone unit="line" n="14"/>Therefore, if it seems best, let this man and the wares be detained until the accusations against him may be examined 
                   in a general tribunal. Farewell. Year 35, Choiach 21.
