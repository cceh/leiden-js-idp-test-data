              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 9*/
              From Aurelius Posidonius, strategus of the Oxyrhynchite nome. Notice is given to the inhabitants of the quarters about to serve in the coming year to assemble to-day at the accustomed place and to name whomever they choose as phylarch, being a person of means and suited for the post, in accordance with the orders of those who constituted the appointed office (?), in order that when the time comes he may be able to perform the duty honestly and faithfully. Signed by me. The first year of the Emperors and Caesars Publius Licinius Valerianus and Publius Licinius Valerianus Gallienus Pii Felices Augusti, Pauni 26.
