              ((1))Sarapammon to his sister Thaësis, greeting. I sent you a jar of wine by one Patas, a sailor. Let me know whether you received it; 
(((8)))for if it was not brought to you, go to the fuller’s shop at Heracleum (?) and find out whether it was delivered to them and get it. 
((13))Go also to the workshop and find out whether the large mortar placed in the portico is safe and sound, and write to me how you are; 
((20))for I intended to return home, but I delayed until I might learn whether you were feeling better or not, and if there is need for me to return.
I pray for your health. Choiak 24. (Addressed) To Iseum for Thaësis from Sarapammon.
