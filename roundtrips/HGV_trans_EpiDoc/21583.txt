               [Translation from P. Oxy. 9] To Sarapas, comogrammateus, from Anteis son of Ammonius son of Anteis, his mother being Tapeëis, of the village of Teïs. ((5))My father Ammonas son of Anteis son of Heracleus, his mother being Tanetbeus, and his full brother Anteis, who were past age, ((10))had no trade, and were registered in the said village of Teïs, died in the past twelfth year of Antoninus Caesar the lord after ((15))the presentation of the accounts. I therefore request that they be registered in the list of dead persons through the ((20))public accounts presented by you, and I swear by the Emperor Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius that the above declaration ((25))is true and that I have made no false statement, otherwise let me be liable to the consequences of the oath. (Date and signature of Anteis written for him by Theon son of Ammonius.)
