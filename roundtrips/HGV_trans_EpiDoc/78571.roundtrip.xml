              ... I received the letter of Thrasybulus at Canopus; accordingly I have not yet obtained the documents, but they are lying collated. Apis the advocate has not yet examined the doeuments, but has delayed from day to day. Since you went away on the 16th, Sabinus has been acting in the business. I told Philomusus to come to you. Send a decoction of cabbage for Ptollas in the load. Homerus salutes you and Tahermas and Phileros and his wife. Take care of yourself, so that you keep in good health. Good-bye. <note>Date. (Addressed) ‘To Thracidas.’</note>
