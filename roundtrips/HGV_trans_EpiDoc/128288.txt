               ((1))To Tiberius Claudius Heraclides, strategus, and Nicander, royal scribe, and Dionysius, district-scribe
of the Upper toparchy, and Sarapion, village-scribe of Cercemunis, and (blank) registrars of the
same Cercemunis, from Sieapis daughter of Sarapion son of Apollonius, mother Aristous daughter
of Ariston, from the city of the Oxyrhynchi, with her son Ariston son of Diogenes as guardian. I register
the house that belongs to me and to my sister, Thais, the so-called ‘granary’, in the same village,
in which no one is registered nor lives; and I swear . . .  (R. Hatzilambrou)
