Be good enough therefore, if you too agree, to take whichever one of them you please and give me back the rest in order that I may gain my living from them. You protected us in the beginning, and now again no one but you will protect us, for the sake of Isis. For I would not have put trust in anyone but you to protect us. May you prosper.’
