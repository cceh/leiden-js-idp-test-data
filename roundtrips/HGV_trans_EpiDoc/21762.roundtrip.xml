              Hermogenes to Ischyras his brother, greeting. Please put on board for me two hundred empty jars, as I asked you before. You have the 16 drachmae of silver by Saras, and I have given Hermas 12 drachmae to give you. If you specially require two pieces of wood to bring down to me the wheel of the machine, they shall be brought up to you by ... For the rest, good-bye. (Addressed) To my dearest Ischyras.
