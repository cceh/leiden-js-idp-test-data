                      Dius also called ....us, who brings you this letter, is a friend of mine. So help (?)
                      him in order that (?) he may buy ---. <milestone unit="line" n="10"/> Write me back through him on any other
                      matter you need in Ptolemais. And buy me a pair of plain cushions and receive the price
                      from him ---.
