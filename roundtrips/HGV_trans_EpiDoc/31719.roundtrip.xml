              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 8</note>
              Concerning the outrage suffered at his abode by my son-in-law Polydeuces I presented to the officials a petition against the perpetrator, Eudaemon; but his influence procured the failure of the petition, so that he should not seem indictable. I accordingly testify to his violence, being a feeble widow woman. For Thonis the curator of Seuthes rushed into my house and dared to carry off my slave Theodora, though he had no power over her, so that I am subjected to unmitigated violence.
