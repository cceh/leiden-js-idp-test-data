               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> ‘To Gaius Arrius Priscus, chief of police, from Horion son of Souchion of Euhemeria in the division of
Themistes. On the 25th of Epeiph of the present 20th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, when I was making an inspection of the … and drying-floor which I had near the so-called Winepress I found that the drying-floor had been cleared, and the … sifted, and a matter of 6 artabae of wheat had been stolen. I suspect that this has been done by the inhabitants of the so-called Winepress. Wherefore I ask you to write to the archephodus of the village that he may make an inquiry and that the authors of the outrage may be brought before you for the ensuing punishment. Farewell. (Signed) I, Horion son of Souchion, have presented the aforesaid petition. The 20th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Epeiph 29.’
