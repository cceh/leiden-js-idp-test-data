vir clarissimus, Pachon 18.

<milestone unit="line" n="3" rend="break"/>To Aurelius Syrion, guild-master, of the illustrious and most illustrious city of the Oxyrhynchites,
from Aurelius Paulus son of Eulogius, of the same city. I acknowledge, swearing the august
divine oath by our masters Valentinianus, Theodosius and Arcadius, the eternal Augusti, by willing
and voluntary resolve to stand surety for Aurelia Apollonia, perfume-seller, for her to deliver to the account of 
the guild, from the eighteenth of the present month of Pachon of the current year (year68/37) up to the completion 
of the fixed term, daily payments of sixty myriads of silver denarii without
interruption, so as to be in no way blameworthy; if she does not, I shall of necessity pay whatever
she may turn out to be owing, or I shall incur the consequences of the oath; and in answer to the
formal question I have given my consent.

<milestone unit="line" n="19" rend="break"/> (2nd hand) I, Aurelius Paulus son of Eulogius, stand surety for the aforementioned Apollonia
paying into the account of the guild sixty myriads daily, as stated above.
