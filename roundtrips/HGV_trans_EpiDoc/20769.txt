I have accordingly been constrained to enter upon the present appellantâ€™s agreement, wherein I agree not to permit your worship to suffer any damage, loss, annoyance, or trouble on my account in this connexion, whether in court or out of court, but on the contrary to guarantee you against annoyance, trouble, loss and damage.

To all this I swear the oath by Heaven and the Emperor, that I will abide by and observe these conditions and will in no wise break them; and I pledge for the observance of this appellant's agreement my property present and future, whether held by myself or my family......
