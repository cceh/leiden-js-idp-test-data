               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> Copy of a memorandum of Valerius (?) Eudaemon, praefect in the ... year of... Caesar our sovereign, Phamenoth .. Application of Psasnis. Psasnis appeared and said :—“I am a doctor by profession and I have treated these very persons who have assigned me a public burden.” Eudaemon said :—“Perhaps your treatment was wrong. If you are a doctor officially practising mummification, tell me what is the solvent, and you shall have the immunity which you claim.”
