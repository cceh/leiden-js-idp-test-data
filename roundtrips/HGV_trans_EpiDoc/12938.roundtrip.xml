                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Tiberius Claudius Philoxenus, strategus and chief of police, from Paes, gardener of Thermoutharion. The shepherds of Ophelion, and his sons Papontos and Ophelion, of Euhemeria in the division of Themistes, let their flocks into the pasturage which I have in the olive-yard of Thermoutharion daughter of Lycarion, and overran, cropped, and utterly destroyed it, doing no slight damage. I beg you to write instructions to the archephodus of the village. And they cut the heads off very many young trees. (Endorsed) To the archephodus: send them up. The 2nd year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, Pharmouthi 9.
