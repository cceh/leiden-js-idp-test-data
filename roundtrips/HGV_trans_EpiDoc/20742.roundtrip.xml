               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> To Flavius Thennyras, logistes of the Oxyrhynchite nome, from Aurelius Nilus, son of Didymus, of the illustrious and most illustrious city of Oxyrhynchus, an egg-seller by trade. I hereby agree on the august, divine oath by our lords the Emperor and the Caesars to offer my eggs in the market-place publicly, for sale and for the supply of the said city, every day without intermission, and I acknowledge that it shall be unlawful for me in the future to sell secretly or in my house. If I am detected so doing, (I shall be liable to the penalty for breaking the oath).
