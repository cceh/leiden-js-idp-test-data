((1)) Nilus to Thalia greetings. I received the small cheeses via Antoninus; when you read my sealed letter you will know how distressed I was. 
(((5))) But now, although I wrote what the matter was two months ago, you write “I have received other letters from you in which you write nothing.”
Well, this is all in the past. For if I find someone reliable, it will be sent to you. Do your best to send me the olives also. 
((10))  Regarding what you need, write to me, knowing that I am not neglectful. Greetings to the excellent Agathopous, even if he too(?) does not write to us.  
I pray for your health, my lady sister.

Know the care which he has taken of your lady friend although she has spent nothing.
