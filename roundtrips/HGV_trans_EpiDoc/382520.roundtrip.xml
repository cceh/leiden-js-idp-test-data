               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> In the seventh year of Imperator Caesar Domitianus Augustus Germanicus. He has worked on (2nd hd.) the dike of Psinalitis (?) (1st hd.) 
for the requisite five days of dike work for the same seventh year, (2nd hd.) on behalf of Karanis; (1st hd.) he cannot use another receipt 
since he claims that the previous one has been lost: (2nd hd.) Herakles/-as, son of Psenobastis, grandson of Papos, whose mother is Segathis.
