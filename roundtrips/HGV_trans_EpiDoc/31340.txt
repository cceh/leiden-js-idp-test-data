               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ From the beneficiarius on duty to the comarchs of the village of Teruthis. Deliver up to my officer whom I have sent Pachoumis, son of Pachoumis, whom you have arrested today and brought to your village, being a citizen. If you have anything to say in his favour, come with him and tell me. See that you do not detain the officer. Signed.
