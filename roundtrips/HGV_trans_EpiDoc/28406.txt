               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ Now please redeem my property from Sarapion. It is pledged for two minae. I have paid the interest up to Epeiph, at the rate of a stater per mina. There is a casket (?) of incense-wood, and another of onyx, a tunic, a white veil with a real purple (border ?), a handkerchief, a tunic with a Laconian stripe, a garment of purple linen, 2 armlets, a necklace, a coverlet, a figure of Aphrodite, a cup, a big tin flask and a wine-jar. From Onetor get the 2 bracelets. They have been pledged since Tybi of last year for eight... at the rate of a stater per mina. If the cash is insufficient owing to the carelessness of Theagenis, if, I say, it is insufficient, sell the bracelets to make up the money. Many salutations to Aia and Eutychia and Alexandra. Xanthilla salutes Aia and all her friends. I pray for your health.
