              A to B, greeting. To-day I appointed you by a public deed drawn up through the record-office here as my representative to collect from Gaius Memmius Cornutus also called Polydeuces, who is at Alexandria, my share of the sums owed by him to my said fatherâ€™s heir, his nephew Heraclides also called Amoitas, but it happens that I have been paid the debt in full. I acknowledge that the contract of representation has been made with you for the sole purpose of your issuing a receipt to the officials without receiving anything, and for cancelling the mortgage, because I have, as aforesaid, already received the money as stated in the autograph receipts which I have issued, and I make no claim on any matter whatever.
            </p>
