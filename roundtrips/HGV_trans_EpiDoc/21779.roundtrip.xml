              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 10</note>
              To Syrion, amphodogrammateus of the 3rd tribe, from Apollonarion daughter of Ilarpalus and Sarapias, of Oxyrhynchus, with her guardian Charmus son of Pausiras and ..., and from Zoilus son of Zoilus son of Apollonius, his mother being Claudia daughter of Theon, of the said city. We wish that now for the first time and henceforth Zoïlus’ legitimate son Horion, his mother being Heras daughter of Apollonius, a payer of twelve drachmae and member of the gymnasium, aged in the present 17th year three years and five months, should be registered in the share of a house owned by me, Apollonarion, in the Broad Street quarter. We accordingly present this memorandum as is fitting, and swear by the fortune of our lords the Emperors Severus and Antoninus and Geta Caesar Augusti that we have made no false statement. <note>Date.</note>
