Phoboou of the same toparchy. And I swear by Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator
that I have honestly and truthfully submitted the return. If I observe the oath, may it be well with
me, but if I swear falsely, the reverse. I, Hierax son of Zoilus, have submitted (the return) and have
sworn the above-written oath. I, Ploution son of Heraclides, wrote on his behalf because he does not
know letters. Year 8 of Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, Payni 3.  (N. Gonis)
