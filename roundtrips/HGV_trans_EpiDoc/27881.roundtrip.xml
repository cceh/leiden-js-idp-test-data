               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> ... When Hermione, my cousin, died without having attained the legal age, leaving as heirs me and my brothers on my mother's side, I registered the half of her property accruing to me and likewise the half of my mother Helene's property according to the laws and the judgements of successive procurators and praefects requiring that the division of property should be made according to households and not individuals, and I will read them when the case is argued.
