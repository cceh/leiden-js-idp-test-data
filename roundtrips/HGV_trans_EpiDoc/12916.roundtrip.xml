               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> ‘Athenodorus, chief of police, from Protarchus son of Ptolemaeus. On the night before the 4th of the
present month Phaophi of the 18th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, certain individuals making a thievish incursion into an olive-yard I possess, in the area of Euhemeria in the division of Themistes at the comer, gathered of the fruits a quantity of olives ; moreover they repeatedly gathered them in the same way and carried them off. Wherefore I request you, if so it seems good, to order a letter to be written that inquiry be made into the matter with a view to the ensuing punishment. Farewell.’
