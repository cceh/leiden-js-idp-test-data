              Alypius to his brother Sarapammon, greeting. I am confident in the first place about my household that if there is any trouble you are supporting me, and I beg you to find out at what price the foster-son of Dionysius, the sealer of Taampemou, is contracting to get barley for me, in order that I may provide for the money. I pray for your health, brother. (Signed) I pray for your health, brother.
