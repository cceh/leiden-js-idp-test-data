               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ After an elaborate introduction, in which the council of Oxyrhynchus through its president Aurelius Apollo addresses the strategus Aurelius Apollonius through Asclepiades, the papyrus proceeds (line 8):â€”At a meeting of our body a dispatch was read from Theodorus who was recently chosen in place of Arion the scribe to proceed to his highness the praefect and attend his immaculate court. In this dispatch he explained that he is a victor in the games and exempt from inquiries ... We have therefore nominated Aurelius ... to serve, and we send you word accordingly, in order that this fact may be brought to his knowledge, and no time be lost in his departure and attendance upon the court. We pray for your health, dearest brother.
