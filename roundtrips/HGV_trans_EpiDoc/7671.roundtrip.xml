               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/>[Philonides to his father, greeting. ...] for in this way it will be possible to win the king’s grace for the future also. 
<milestone unit="line" n="6"/>Nothing truly will be dearer to me than to support you for the rest of your life in a manner worthy of you and of myself, 
and if some fate of mankind befalls you, to see that you enjoy all due honours. <milestone unit="line" n="9"/>This will be my chief desire, 
to support you in a decent way both while you live and when you have departed to the gods. If possible, then, 
make every effort to obtain your permanent release, or if you see this is not possible, at least for the period when the Nile retreats, 
at which time there is no danger and it will be possible to leave Theodoros behind to do the same, 
in order that you may reside (with us) at least for that period of time. <milestone unit="line" n="15"/>Lay this to your heart, that nothing painful shall befall you, 
but that every care will be taken by me to see that you are without grief. [Farewell].
