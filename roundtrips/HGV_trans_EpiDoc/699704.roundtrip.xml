                         greetings. I, Peep...es, son of P...kes, Arsinoite, ... the contractor for the retailing and
                         the tax upon the ... juniper resin ..., am being wronged by (?)
                         some ibis-buriers in the nome ...
                         who, on the one hand, ... numerous burials ...
                         of those selling illegally and ...
                         of some temples (sacred things?) and distribute to others ...
                         they purchased nothing at all from the royal (?) place of sale ... until
                  <milestone unit="line" n="9"/> now it has not happened that they are punished ...
                         and the damage to me is not inconsiderable ...
                         accuse the ibis-buriers falsely ...
