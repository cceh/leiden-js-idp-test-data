                  ((1)) ‘Ammonius to his dearest Aphrodisius, greeting. I wrote a letter to the herdsman Heracleus that he
should supply you with a donkey, and I bade Ophelion also to supply you with another and to send me the loaves. You have sent me 3 artabae ; I ask you therefore to do your utmost to send the remaining 3 artabae immediately and the relish, as I am on board a boat. As to the pigs’ fodder and the rest of the price for the hay make provision until I come; for I expect to make up an account with you. I have given you every allowance. Urge your wife from me to look after the pigs and do you also take care of the calf. Be sure, Aphrodisius, to send me the loaves and the relish; and if you will, write me to whom I shall pay a further 20 dr. for hay and fodder. Good-bye. The 2nd year of Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, Mecheir 26. (Addressed) To Aphrodisius, agent.’
