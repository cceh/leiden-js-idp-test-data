                  ((1)) To Zenon, greetings, Teos. While I was making the journey to Philadelphia, I was attacked by a robber. 
Later, on a visit to Arsinoë, I found the man who had attacked me and pointed him out to Hermais, the archiphylakitês there. 
Please write a letter to Hermais so that he may send this person to you, so that I, who have fled to you, may receive justice. Farewell.
