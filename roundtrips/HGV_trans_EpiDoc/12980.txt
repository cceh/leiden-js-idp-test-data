               ((1)) ‘Syrus to his dearest Heroninus, greeting. Send another team of four donkeys to the city in place of Akes to carry fodder for the riding donkeys and horses coming up; let them have the older bundles. And when they come, let them bring up timber to the magistrate’s house to be handed over to Zosimus the driver. I pray for your health, dearest friend. The 3rd year, Tubi 15. Have two beams (?) cut at once for oil-presses so that they may go to the press of Ammonius, oil-maker at Narmouthis.’
