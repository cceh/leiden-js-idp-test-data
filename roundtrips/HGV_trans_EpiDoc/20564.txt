              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 2*/
              Dionysius to his sister Didyme many greetings, and good wishes for continued health. You have sent me no word about the clothes either by letter or by message, and they are still waiting until you send me word. Provide the bearer of this letter, Theonas, with any assistance that he wishes for.... Take care of yourself and all your household. Good-bye.
