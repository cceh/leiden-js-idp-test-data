              Aurelius Dius to Aurelius Horion my sweetest father, many greetings. I perform the act of veneration for you every day before the gods of this place. Do not be anxious, father, about my studies; I am industrious and take relaxation: all will be well with me. I salute my mother Tamiea and my sister Tnepherous and my sister Philous, I salute my brother Patermouthis and my sister Thermouthis, I salute my brother Heracl ... and my brother Kollouchis, I salute my father Melanus and my mother Timpesouris and her son. Gaia salutes you all, my father Horion and Thermouthis salute you all. I pray for your health, father. (Addressed) Deliver to Aurelius Horion from his son Dius.â€™
