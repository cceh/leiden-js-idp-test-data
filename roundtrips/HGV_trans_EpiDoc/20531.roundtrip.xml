              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 2</note>
              The end year of Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, the ... of the month Neos Sebastos, at the city of Oxyrhynchus in the Thebaid. Demetria, citizen, daughter of Chaeremon, acting with her guardian Theon, son of Antiochus, of the Auximetorean or Lenean deme, and husband of her granddaughter Demetria, citizen, acknowledges to Chaeremon, son of Chaeremon, of the Maronian deme, her grandson and brother of her granddaughter Demetria (the contract taking place in the street), concerning the case which the contracting party Demetria claims to have against Epimachus, son of Polydeuces, or which Epimachus claims to have against her, since she is unable owing to womanly weakness to remain at the court, that she has appointed her said grandson Chaeremon to appear for her before every authority and every court which would be open to Demetria herself if she were present; for she gives her consent to this appointment. The agreement is valid.
