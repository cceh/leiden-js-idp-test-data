               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ Paësius to his dearest Archelaus, greeting. The bearer of this letter is the captain Panemouôs; please to see that his freight is embarked with all despatch, and let it consist as usual of what you have in hand and selected for lading. Send up the inspectors yourself to the examination, getting a donkey from the chiefs of the police. After this give him your best attention and let him see the granaries, and prepare the overseers and the other officials concerned, whose names have been given you by Harpocration, in order that there may be no delay. My best wishes for your health, dearest friend.
