               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Numerius to his most honoured brother Longinus, many greetings. Whatever you give to Doras
                      who brings the ostracon, consider that you are giving it to me. <milestone unit="line" n="7"/> As for the bags, do not worry, since
                      I bring them tomorrow or the day after tomorrow at the latest. But if the caravan comes by, expect
                      me there. Farewell, most honoured.
