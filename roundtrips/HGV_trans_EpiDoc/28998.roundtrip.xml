              <milestone unit="line" n="1"/>Sarapammon to his sister Thaësis, greeting. I sent you a jar of wine by one Patas, a sailor. Let me know whether you received it; 
<milestone unit="line" n="8" rend="break"/>for if it was not brought to you, go to the fuller’s shop at Heracleum (?) and find out whether it was delivered to them and get it. 
<milestone unit="line" n="13"/>Go also to the workshop and find out whether the large mortar placed in the portico is safe and sound, and write to me how you are; 
<milestone unit="line" n="20"/>for I intended to return home, but I delayed until I might learn whether you were feeling better or not, and if there is need for me to return.
I pray for your health. Choiak 24. (Addressed) To Iseum for Thaësis from Sarapammon.
