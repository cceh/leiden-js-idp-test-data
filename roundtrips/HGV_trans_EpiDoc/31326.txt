              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 6*/
              Demarchus to his sister Taor, very many greetings. I would have you know that you wrote to me about what Agathinus did to me. Well, if I live and come to my native land I will have my revenge. And for the present I bid you, my dear sister, go to the street of the theatre and find out about the stone bow! in the boat and warn them all there, Philocyrus and Zosimus, to keep a watch on it, lest Agathinus should determine to take the bowl. Write me a reply through the man from Antinoöpolis about whom I sent to you, and write the list there, that you have received so and so. If the man from Antinoöpolis wants anything provide him with it, and come with him to meet Tasoitas. Send your cloak and the jar of pickled fish and two cotylae of good oil. I pray for your health. You will receive three bags from the man from Antinoöpolis who is the bearer of this letter. (Addressed) Deliver to my sister Taor from Demarchus.
