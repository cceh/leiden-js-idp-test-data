               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ To Julius, village-scribe of Sesphtha, from Cephalas, son of Leontas and Ploutarche, of the same village of Sesphtha. My son who is here indicated, Panechotes, son of Cephalas, son of Leontas, his mother being Herais, of the same village of Sesphtha, died childless in Athyr of the present year. I therefore send this announcement and ask that his name be entered in the list of the dead, as is fitting, and I swear by the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus that the above statements are correct.
