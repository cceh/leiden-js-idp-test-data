               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Ptolemais to her brother Papirianus, greetings.
               <milestone unit="line" n="3"/> Talbaeis – as you instructed her about the house – she goes out and does
                      what she wants, even if I tell her, “stay still!” <milestone unit="line" n="6"/> ... was unable ... And so I write to
                      you, sir, so that you know ... since (?) you went upcountry. <milestone unit="line" n="9"/> As you instructed
                      me about the money, “from which ... the wife of Pasion,” I collected one artaba
                      from her. <milestone unit="line" n="12"/> She said to me, “when your brother comes down, I’ll give the other
                      one as well.” <milestone unit="line" n="14"/> Zoilas did not give me money (?) for the bricks. He says, “they’re
                      not dry,” and I went off to Onesimos. <milestone unit="line" n="17"/> He did not find him: he’s with you in the
                      city. Until today Talbaeis is out. <milestone unit="line" n="19"/> If I say to her, “... here,” she takes no account
                      of me and ... <milestone unit="line" n="21"/> I was intending to drive her to the metropolis to you, (but) I
                      couldn’t get her under my sway (?).
             <milestone unit="line" n="23"/> I pray that you are well, brother.
