                  ((1)) Heracles to his dearest Musaeus, greetings. I request you to regard as introduced
                         to you Dioscorus, who will deliver the letter to you; ((6)) he is a very close friend of mine.
                         By doing this, you will be conferring a favour on me. Farewell. Pharmuthi 13 (?).
