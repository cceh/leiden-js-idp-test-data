((1)) Crispus to Niger his brother, greetings. (((3))) I ordered also Domitius about the young pig up to twenty drachmas, 
in order that we have it for the festival. Therefore do not be negligent but buy and deliver it to Domitius in order that, 
if the provisions come up, the principalis may put it on board and carry (it). ((9)) And if you do not have money, 
come to an agreement and ... to Domitius and we will give it to the cibariates principalis and he 
will carry it. Therefore do not do otherwise; for the right time is here.
(((15))) I wish you well, brother.
