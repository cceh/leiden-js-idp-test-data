                         this would be fine. We are in good health too. I have often written to you to come over and introduce
                         me, so that I may be relieved from my present unemployment. And now, if it is possible and
                         nothing of the works prevents you, try to come for the Arsinoeia. I am convinced that if you come,
                         I will be easily introduced to the King. <milestone unit="line" n="5"/> Know that I have received from Philonides 70 drachmas.
                         From this I have left half for daily expenses, the remainder I have paid for the loan. That happens
                         because we do not get all our money at once, but in small instalments. Do write us yourself also,
                         so that we may know how you are and so that we do not worry. Take care of yourself that you may
                         be well and that you may come to us in good health. Respectfully.
               </p>
