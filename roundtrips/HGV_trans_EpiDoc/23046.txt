               ((1)) Marcus Aurelius Sarapion, son of Mikkalos, and however I am styled, to
                      Marcus Aurelius Horion, veteran honourably discharged, greetings. ((4)) I acknowledge
                      that I have received from you your ammokopregon river boat,
                      with Myrismos as its ensign, with mast, and yard, and sails made (padded?)
                      with rush-mats … with four punt poles with iron heads … and two other
                      punt poles?, and with a rope … and anchor cables?, with bilge boards, so
                      that I perform with it the ammokopregike work, with sufficient crew, for
                      twelve months from the tenth of the present month. ((13)) And of all produced
                      fertiliser, I shall pay you the share of one third, blamelessly and in
                      exemplary fashion. And I shall pay…
