               ((5)) ‘…putting off everything, take Castor with you, and by all means get it made forthwith, so that the watering of the garden of Sentrepaei be not neglected, and remain with the men there. Receive from my mother on account 20 drachmae, and if you have need again, let me know, for the animals go up continually. If any neglect occurs, you will not blame me but yourself. By all means send the receipt … Serenus has often defrauded us … Let Castor go to him at Philagris expressly and ask for the 8½ artabae of wheat. Good-bye. Tubi 5. Look out everywhere for a small donkey for him.’
