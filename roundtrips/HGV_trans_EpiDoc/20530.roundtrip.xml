              Copy. Antiphanes, son of Ammonius, of the city of Oxyrhynchus, to the agents of Tiberius Claudius Ammonius, strategus and superintendent of the revenues of the Oxyrhynchite nome. I swear by Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, that in accordance with the agreement made between me and Antiphanes, son of Heraclas, in consequence of our confronting each other before the strategus Tiberius Claudius Ammonius, I will appear at the court of the chief justice Sarapion at Alexandria until the 30th day of the present month Epeiph, and will remain until our suit is decided. If I swear truly may it be well with me, if falsely, the reverse. The 5th year of Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, Epeiph 9.
