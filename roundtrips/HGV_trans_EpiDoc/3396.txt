                  ((1)) (lines 1–13) To Dionysios, tôn philôn and stratêgos, from Ptolemaios, son of Glaukias, Macedonian, in detention (katochê) 
in the great Serapieion for ten years, not having left the priestly chamber in which I have been enclosed up to the present day. 
On the 16th of Thoth, Ptolemaios, the man appointed by the archiphylakitês in the Anoubieion, and Amosis, agent of the archiereus, 
taking phylakitai, entered into the Astartieion in the great Serapieion, where I have been in detention (katochê) up to the present day, 
alleging that there were weapons in that place. After making a search of the whole place, they found nothing. Once the phylakitai had exited, 
they took off after doing nothing unseemly.
