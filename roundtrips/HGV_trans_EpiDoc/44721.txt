                  ((1)) To Dioskourides, hegemon and garrison commander, from Iason and Petalos, those in charge of the 
                   tax on hides in the Herakleopolite nome in year 35. (((7)))On the 21st of Choiach, after discovering 9 donkey hides, we handed them 
                   over to Apollonios and Epimachos, your agents; and to you, we handed over Didymos, the man who had smuggled them. 
                   ((14))Therefore, if it seems best, let this man and the wares be detained until the accusations against him may be examined 
                   in a general tribunal. Farewell. Year 35, Choiach 21.
