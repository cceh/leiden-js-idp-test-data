               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Soumaios to Yonathes
                      son of Beianos and to
                      Masabala, greetings.
               <milestone unit="line" n="4"/> Since I have sent to
                      you Agrippa, hurry
                      to send me
                      wands and citrons,
                      as much as you will be able,
                      for the camp of the Jews,
                      and do not do otherwise.
             <milestone unit="line" n="11"/> It (scil. the letter) was written
                      in greek because of
                      our inability to write Jewish script. Release
                      him (i.e., Agrippa)
                      more quickly
                      on account of the festival,
                      and do not do otherwise.
             <milestone unit="line" n="20"/> (2nd hand) Soumaios, farewell.
