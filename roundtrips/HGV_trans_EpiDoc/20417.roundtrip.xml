              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 4</note>
              To his highness the epistrategus Titus Claudius Xenophon from ... Antistius Primus also called Lollianus, ..., ex-chief-priest ... of the city of Oxyrhynchus ... I bought from Dionysius ... with Alexander the land at Sennis... belonging to him in consequence of the division made with . . . and his brother Apollonius the younger, namely 52 1/2 arourae of corn-land and 1/2 aroura of building-land, free from obligations in respect of Crown land or Imperial estates or temple land, in accordance with the division made by me with the (my?) brothers, the taxes upon the private land only being paid by me. A very long while afterwards, forty years having elapsed, it somehow happened after the death of the seller Dionysius that the komogrammateus of ..., to whose district Sennis also belongs, in answer to an inquiry concerning the landlord from whom the demand should be made of the imposts for 4 arourae of Crown land amounting to 15 artabae of wheat, stated that these 4 arourae of Crown land were included in the 53 arourae belonging to me which I bought from Dionysius and..., and that therefore the imposts ought to be paid by me..., although I have never had Crown land included in mine nor cultivate any and am altogether ignorant of the statements of the komogrammateus, and although the imposts for the said 4 arourae have for years been paid in the regular course by others. Therefore since I have incurred no small loss and it is unjust that I should be asked to pay the imposts on land which does not belong to me and which I do not cultivate, I beg you, if you think fit, to write to the strategus of the nome, in order that in accordance with the decrees he may direct the officials whose duty it is to ... the 4 arourae of Crown land declared by the komogrammateus to be included in my private land, and may state the owner from whom the demand for the imposts may reasonably be made; for I shall retain a claim for the sums with which I was wrongfully charged against the person proved to be responsible for the payment, that so I may obtain relief. Farewell. (Signed) Presented by me, ... Antistius Primus also called Lollianus, through Apollonius...
