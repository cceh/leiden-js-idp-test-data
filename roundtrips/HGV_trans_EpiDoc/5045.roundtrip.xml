<milestone unit="line" n="3"/>I declare that I have received from you the three metretes of wine, including the half thereof, which I shall pay back to you in the month of Epeiph 
of the third year from my own vintage, new, good wine with the measure with which I usually pour out. <milestone unit="line" n="11"/>If, however, I do not pay it back as is written, 
I shall pay you three thousand copper drachmas for each keramion as fine. This document shall be valid wherever it may be produced. 
In the third year, the ninth Pachon.
