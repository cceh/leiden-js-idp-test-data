              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 2*/
              Copy of a bond. Theon, son of Ammonius, a Persian of the Epigone, to Demetrius, governor of the prison of Zeus. I swear by Tiberius Caesar Novus Augustus Imperator, that I have thirty days in which to restore to you the man whom I bailed out of the public prison in Phaophi of the present year, Sarapion, son of Sarapion, arrested through Billus, assistant to the dioecetes, on account of a note of hand for a gold bracelet weighing two minae to Magianus on behalf of Aline, citizen, daughter of Dionysius. If I do not produce him within the said number of days, I will pay the said two minae of gold without delay, and I have no power to obtain a further period of time nor to transfer myself to another prison. If I swear truly, may it be well with me, but if falsely, the reverse. 9th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Pachon 22.
