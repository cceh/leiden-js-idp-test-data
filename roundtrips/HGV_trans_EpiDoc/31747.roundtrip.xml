              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 12</note>
              Heraclides to the most notable Sarapion, greeting. Demetrius, the certifier, asked me to speak to you, so that he may be freed from anxiety about the previous years. He says “I helped him greatly in the matter of the annona.” He says that the annona is now being claimed. If then you can again get him off by yourself(?), good luck to you; but if not, give instructions as to what preparations you wish to be made. Do not neglect this, for they have not yet gone away. If you are strong enough to get him off, it will be a great achievement, since I have no cattle or pigs. I pray for your complete health.
