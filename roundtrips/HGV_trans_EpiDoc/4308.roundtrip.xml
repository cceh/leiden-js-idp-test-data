                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Horenis to Sosibios, greetings. When Petesouchos, the man in charge of the phylakitai in Thmoiobastis, 
came to see us it was reported that there had been some thefts at the royal threshing-floor on the night of Pachon 4, 
and that the thieves had made off with 14 artabas of grain; and (it was reported that) after he had carried out a search 
with the phylakitai he discovered eight measures of the stolen grain in the house of Petesouchos, son of Horos, 
which he handed over to Agathis, phylakitês, while we ourselves were present. And similarly (it was reported that) 
he discovered at the threshing-floor of Kales that 6 measures of grain had been removed from their sacks; and applying a seal, 
we transferred (the grain) to the royal granary. Since, therefore, both Petesouchos (i.e., Petesouchos, son of Horos) and Kales, 
having had a hand in this business, have fled, I make this report so that you may know. Farewell. Year 40, Pachon 15.
