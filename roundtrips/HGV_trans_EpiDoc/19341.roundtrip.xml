grandson of Constantius, monk from the village of Aphrodite of the Antaiopolite nome to Aurelius Psentereus, son of Hakoreios, from the same village, greetings. 
<milestone unit="line" n="6"/> I have leased from you for a period of four years from the harvest of the coming, God willing, ninth indiction, including the present indiction, the Akonos and Chatidos 
chorion which belongs to you, in the Pchetos Topothesia, bought by you from Eulogios, son of Hatres, so that I perform without deficiency or negligence every maintenance 
and to water … necessary. <milestone unit="line" n="14"/> And each year, when the time of harvest comes, it will be divided between us in two equal parts. And also, in the same fashion for 
(the estate of) Therapeuterion and of Chatidos Chorion, so you take the harvest of the current eighth indiction and not for the farming part. <milestone unit="line" n="18"/> The lease is valid and secure and, 
having been asked the formal question, I gave my consent. † 
<milestone unit="line" n="20" rend="break"/> (hand 2) I, Aurelius Isaak, the aforementioned, leased as stated. (hand 1) I will also water the reed-ground there in the same fashion as my estate. I also take an oath 
that I have not concealed anything, as stated. <milestone unit="line" n="23"/> (hand 2) The same Isaak, as stated.
