              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 10*/
              TasoiÌˆs to her most esteemed Dionysius, greeting. See, I have not imitated you by taking away my son, but if you intend to blame him in this way, I shall send Ptolemaeus and take him away. When his father died, I paid on his behalf 1,300 drachmae and expended on clothes for him 60 drachmae. I therefore beg tha: you will not persuade him to desert me, or I shall take him away and put him in pledge at Alexandria. So please send me a payment for two months through the bearer of this letter and the cloak, and let me know how much money you have given to him and whether you have received the cloak. Send the veil to your brother. Good-bye. (Addressed) To Dionysius from Tasois.
