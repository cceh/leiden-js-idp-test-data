               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> To Aurelius Ammonius, gymnasiarch, prytanis in office of Oxyrhynchus, from Julia Dionysia, daughter of Sarapiacus, son of Sarapammon. In answer to your inquiry about my house situated in the quarter of Temienouthis, about which ... whether it belonged to me or to my husband Aurelius Sarapiacus, I swear by the fortune of Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander the lord Caesar that the house in question and all its contents belong to me, Julia Dionysia, in accordance with the written statements which I gave you, and that I have herein spoken only the truth.
