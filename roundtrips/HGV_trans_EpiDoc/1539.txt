                  [Translation from Rowlandson, Women and Society 1998] Haynchis to Zenon, greetings. I take beer from the large beer-shop and dispose of 4 drachmas worth daily, and pay regularly. But Demetrios the vine-dresser, having deceived my daughter, has carried her off and conceals her saying he will set up house with her without my consent. And she helped me to manage the shop and supported me in my old age. Now therefore since she has gone away I am making a loss and I do not have the necessities of life. And he has another wife and children here, so that he cannot consort with the woman he has deceived. I therefore ask you to help me on account of my old age, and return her to me.
