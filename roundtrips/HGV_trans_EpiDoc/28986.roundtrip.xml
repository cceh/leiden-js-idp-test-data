              ... to the lady Didyme his sister, greeting. Receive from the slave of the strategus a ... chest containing two parchment quaternions and a cloak ... and a box, and from Didymus the sailor a bread-basket containing 4 glass flasks in sound condition, and a good strap tied to the basket, and 3 knives; of these take one for yourself. And from Carpus son of Cleon receive the key of the bread-basket. If you cannot open the basket yourself, for it opens with difficulty,give it to the key-maker, and he will open it for you ... Take care of the things in the box lest they rot. Do not lose heart about the rent, for you will get it once for all. Tell me through the sailor about al these things, whether you have received them,and if you require anything, let me know. I salute Tausiris my daughter and Sarapas. Good-bye, sister. ... 20th. (Addressed) To Didyme.
