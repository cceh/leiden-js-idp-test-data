concerning any matter written or unwritten, adjudicated or not, 
<milestone unit="line" n="25" rend="break"/> neither concerning the union of marriage and its bridal gifts and dowry and marriage expenses nor about household utensils which were brought in for each other by each other, 
nor concerning any matter in general, <milestone unit="line" n="28"/> but also that I, the aforementioned Theodoros give up for the kids (we had) so far together with the baby in the womb …
