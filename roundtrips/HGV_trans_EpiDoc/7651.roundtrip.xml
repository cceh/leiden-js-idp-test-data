                 <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Alexandros to Kleon, greetings. A remnant of the drainage channel running from Tebetnou and Samareia to Kerkeesis which we dug last year, is left unfinished. Please order that the salt tax for the natives of Kerkeesis be reduced by 200 drachmas, for which they shall pay in aoilia (of sand) removed, at the rate of 4 drachmas for every 60 aoilia, so that it may be completed and the land does not become waterlogged. <milestone unit="line" n="5"/> Send us the rest of the 200 wooden beams, as long and as thick as possible, so that we have them to serve as joists for the bridges. For we are being held up by these. And send us ropes as well, 100 of them, but if there are more, 200.
Farewell. Year 31, Payni 16.
