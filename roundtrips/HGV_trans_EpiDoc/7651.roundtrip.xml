There has been a silting-up of the drainage channel that we dug last year running from Tebetnou and Samareia to Kerkeesis. Please order a remission of the salt-tax amounting to 200 drachmas for the natives of Kerkeesis, to be paid instead in measures of dirt removed (aoilia), at the rate of 4 drachmas for every 60 aoilia, so that the work may be completed and the land not become <milestone unit="line" n="5"/> waterlogged. With what is left of the 200 drachmas send us wooden beams, so that we have planks that are as long and as thick as possible for our bridges, since we are being held up for these. And if there is more of the 200 drachmas, please send us 100 ropes. Farewell. Year 31, Pauni 16 (7 August 254 BC). [Translation from P. Count 2, p. 43]
