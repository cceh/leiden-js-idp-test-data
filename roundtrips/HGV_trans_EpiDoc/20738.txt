               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ [11 sqq.] From Aurelius Sarapas. Having lately bought from some one the hereinafter described land(?), and having registered it in accordance with the command of his excellency Marcellus and the most high Sallustarius, I find in the taxing list which has just been issued that this land is still entered in the name of the previous holder. Therefore, to prevent the appearance of my having taken advantage of the tax-collectorâ€™s ignorance, I send you this memorandum in order that you may ... tell him what steps ought to be taken to rectify the error.
