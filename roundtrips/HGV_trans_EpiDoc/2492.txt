((1)) Panakestor to Kleon, greetings. We have already sent you (a letter) on the 29th also, 
asking you to send out a crew to construct the bends of the small canal. You seem to have passed by, however, on your way to the Little Lake. 
You should not have paid by, though, but rather have come along to us for a moment and, having seen for yourself that the land is not being irrigated, 
you should have asked for what reason we do not irrigate. ((5)) For you have not been appointed to supervise only the works 
(at the) Little Lake, but also those at this (land). Even now, come to meet us tomorrow at the sluice and give instructions on 
how the water is to be conducted into side channels, for we lack experience. We will provide you with workmen and other supplies, 
as much as you order. ((8)) If, however, you do not come, we will be compelled to write to Apollonios 
that his land alone in the Lake district is uninundated, even though we were willing to provide all that is needed. 
Farewell. Year 29, Mesore 21.
