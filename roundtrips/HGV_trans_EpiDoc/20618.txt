              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 3*/
              (I register), apart from what I have previously registered and sold, now at the present time the third share which belongs to me at the village of Senemeleu of two shares out of four shares out of five shares of a joint house and the court adjoining it on the south side and other fixtures and entrances and exits and appurtenances, situated in a cavalry soldier’s quarters, which share has devolved upon me with other property from my late father Diogenes son of Ptolemaeus son of Ptolemaeus, his mother being Tekosis daughter of Harthoönis, of the said city, in accordance with the will which he drew up in his lifetime through the record-office at the said city in the month Tubi of the first year of the deified Nerva, which will was unchanged at his death. And I swear by the Emperor Caesar Nerva Trajanus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus that I have given no false information. /*Date.*/
