I want you to know that I heard from those who have come to me that you have been ill; but I was glad to hear that you have gotten better. I ask you earnestly and beg you, take care of yourself and also of the little girl, so that you may get through the winter, so that we may find you in good health. We are also all well. And concerning the Syrian woman, up to now nothing bad. I ask you if you hear about Thermouthas, send me word. I ask you—it isn't a big deal—if you find anyone coming down, send me word concerning your health and the little girl's. I ask you and beg, if it is possible, for you to see the little girl three times a day. Think that I am near you. I will send you the earring now, for mine hasn't been made yet. If Esas the son of Thermouthas finds you a (good) price, sell (it). Also pay us a visit. Receive from . . .ktor a salotion,
