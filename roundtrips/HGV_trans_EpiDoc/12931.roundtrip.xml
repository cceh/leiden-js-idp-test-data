Chaeremon son of Moschas, who was formerly a brewer on the estate, not content with heaping insults on my dependants, caught Artemidorus, now my brewer, and gave him many blows all over his body, and robbed him of a female donkey, a sack full of cnecus, 40 silver drachmae, and clothes. I beg you to write to the archephodus of Taurinus, where they live, to send up the accused persons. Farewell. (Endorsed) To the archephodus: send them up. Tubi 3, the 3rd year of Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus.
