                  ((7)) The so-called accounting scribes up to now active in the Catalogue should according to the old
usage keep track of the agreements, including the names of the nomographoi and the contracting
parties and the values of the transactions and the types of contracts and they should deposit them in
both libraries. The so-called eikonistai shall, when they check the so-called composite roll for
deposition, add a marginal note when something has been expunged or anything else added. And
after a copy has been made on a single papyrus roll they will deposit it in both libraries. For I order
that what is now observed in the Arsinoite and [...]polite nomes shall happen in the rest of Egypt as
well. They shall also add the number of the (pasted) sheets and the names of the contracting
parties. (lines 7-15: M. Depauw, ZPE 176 (2011), p. 197).
