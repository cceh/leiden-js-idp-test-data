               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> To Epimachus and Theon, keepers of the archives, from Zoilus, son of Apollonius, son of Ptollion, his mother being Ptolema, daughter of Ischurion, an inhabitant of the village of Enepta in the middle toparchy. I register for Marcus Porcius, who happens to be away, in obedience to the orders of the lord praefect Mettius Rufus, a piece of unwooded land which at present belongs to Marcus, in the the village of Petne in the same toparchy in the southern part of the village, which he bought from Tiberius Julius Basilides through Tiberius Julius Philetas in accordance with his rights over it.
