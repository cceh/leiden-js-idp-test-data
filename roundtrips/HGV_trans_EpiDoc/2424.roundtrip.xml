Be good enough to make ready all the things required for the reception according to the memorandum and to send them down by the 10th of Choiach or the 12th. And please come yourself along with your brothers; for I am sacrificing both on my behalf and on yours. Make also 25 plates, each of them 1 cubit 8 fingerbreadths in diameter, to be given to the banqueters as at the festival of Hermes. I have sent you the measurement of the plates, for they say here that they will not be able to make them of such a size, though at present they are being compelled to supply a couple. Farewell.
