I acknowledge the receipt from you at the Serapeum at Oxyrhynchus through the bank of Archibius, son of Archibius, of the sum of 52 silver drachmae of the Imperial coinage, which is the total amount of my debt. I will repay you on the 30th of the month Caesareus of the current 3rd year of Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, without any delay. If I do not repay you in accordance with this agreement, I will forfeit to you the aforesaid sum with the addition of one half, with proper interest for the overtime, for which you are to have the right of execution upon me and upon all my property, as if in accordance with a legal decision. This note of hand is valid wherever produced and whosoever produces it.
