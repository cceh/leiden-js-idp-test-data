               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Zenon, greetings, Pais, the brother of Patis. From the time when I arrived in the area I have never plundered, nor stolen, 
nor has anyone come to lay a charge against me before you. It has now been five months since I was arrested. Everything has abandoned me, 
so as for me to now be in need even of the necessities. Now, therefore, I have fled to you as a suppliant. I have no other helper save you. 
I swear by your fortune and the fortune of the king that I have been falsely arrested. Also you yourself know that I am among the well-behaved. 
Bail me out on my guarantee to appear, and after I get out I will provide you with guarantors. Farewell.
