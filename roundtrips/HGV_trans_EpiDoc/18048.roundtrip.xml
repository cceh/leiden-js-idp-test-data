                  [Translation from Martin, JEA  15 1927] The admirable Dioscoros who is handing this letter of mine over to your illustrious sublimity is of the land of Theba√Ød. Having been wronged, as he says, by certain persons there, reporting the damage sustained therefrom, he came to this royal city and, having become a suppliant of the most pious lord, he obtained sacred letters addressed to your humanity. Rightly understanding that the assistance derived from your justice is the only sure protection for him, he wishes to obtain it from you and has demanded this letter for you about his case. I know that, even without my request, justice is given to him and to all others by your sublimity. I urge however that a little more zeal be bestowed on the admirable Dioscoros, so that I myself may show myself useful to him and you may receive much more abundantly the reward from our Lord God.
