              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 7*/
              We have mediated between Gerontius and John to this effect :— John shall take the cloaks and the linen with the veils and the kerchiefs to be sold, and shall pay the loan of the three solidi; and we have given them to Gerontius to be sold for their value, as to the amount of which an oath shall be taken(?); and the remainder shall be paid to John for the expenses of his children. The articles sold are as follows :— an onyx-coloured Dalmatian vest at 33,850,000 denarii; another likewise of the Xoïte kind at 30,000,000; a ... linen cloth with a common kerchief at 1 solidus; a kerchief at 7,500,000; a towel and a linen cloth at 13,000,000 denarii. The unsold articles are as follows :— 1 small hide, 1 onyx-coloured veil, 1 Xoïte veil, 1 ... veil, a woman's box, a little shrine to hold unguents; these are to be sold through Theodorus and Gerontius for their value. Expenses through Gerontius amount to 18,600,000 denarii. We, Andreas and Triadelphus, presbyters, are witnesses.
