The owners of the open plot in front of your gate-house are villagers; I will refer it to Heraclius to send to them. I send you the account from the beginning up to the 14th of Pauni written continuously but divided into four sections to be submitted to your guardian, in order that he, having fresh in his mind the prices of the fittings which he buys, may have no suspicion in matters relative to the account.
