              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 2</note>
              To Papiscus, ex-kosmetes of the city and strategus of the Oxyrhynchite nome, and Ptolemaeus, royal scribe, and the scribes of the nome, from Harmiusis, son of Petosiris, son of Petosiris, his mother being Didyme, daughter of Diogenes, of the village of Phthochis in the eastern toparchy. I registered in the present 12th year of Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator in the neighbourhood of the said Phthochis twelve lambs which were born from sheep in my possession, and I now register for the second: registration a further progeny of seven lambs born from the same sheep, total seven lambs; and I swear by Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator that I have not prevaricated. Farewell.
              <note>There follow the signatures, of Apollonius, agent of Papiscus, Horion, agent of Ptolemaeus, and Zenon, agent of the 'scribes of the nome.'</note>
