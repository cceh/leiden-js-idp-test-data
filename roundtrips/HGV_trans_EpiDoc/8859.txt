As many as have vineyards or gardens in any way whatsoever, let them all—either they themselves or their managers or those farming their possessions—

the amount of their produce and to what temple they gave the one-sixth tax (apomoira) and how much (they gave) this year. And similarly, (let) the priests 
also, each of them, (give oaths indicating) from what kind of property they were receiving however much wine or money (they received) in this year. 
And similarly, let the basilikoi grammateis and the … give… oaths of these…
