                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/>Nikeratos to Kleon, greetings. Regarding the northern wall of the ochyrôma, a certain part of it has collapsed, 
and the remaining part is in such a condition so as to pose a risk, if it collapses, that one of the slaves (sômata) will escape. 
Therefore you will do well to draw up a contract for (the repair of) it, and to give it to Dionysios the house-builder, 
so that he may carry it out. For straightaway, bringing out (the prisoners/slaves?), we will need to make use of a larger space, 
because of the desmôtai who have now been handed over by Apollonios the dioikêtês. Farewell. Year 30, Hathyr 16.
