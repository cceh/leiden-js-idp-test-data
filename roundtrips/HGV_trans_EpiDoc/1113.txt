               ((1)) Memorandum from Nikias to Zenon. We sent a mare to pasture in Boutos of the Memphite nome on the seventh. On the eighth, she ran off, seeking her mother. She left the path on which she was accustomed to travel. The phylakitai from Simyra, seizing her, shut her up. A phylakitês from Boutos and a brother-in-law of mine followed her tracks. Finding her, they took possession of her; but when the phylakitês Noumenios arrived, he arrested them. Therefore, I ask that you, if it seems best, write to him about these matters. Farewell.
