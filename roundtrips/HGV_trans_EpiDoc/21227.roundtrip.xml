my home-born slave, coming from the village of Pouchis of the Antaipolites nome, greetings. 
<milestone unit="line" n="7"/> Willing to find mercy in the moment my death, in the terryfing judgement or our Lord Jesus Christ, I set you, the afore-mentioned Menas, free from any chin of slavery, in order to find, as mentioned above,

or remaind you, or annoy you or …  concerning any matter in general (either) in or out of court, in or out of the province, low or high, neither through my heirs, nor through my representative, 
or any other intermediary, for I completed this manumission for you willing and convinced.
<milestone unit="line" n="22"/> For your security, and that this the matter and that I shall not withdraw, I took an oath by the holy and consubstantial Trinity, and my holy dignity, 
and of the safety, victory and continuity of our serene lords Flavius Mauricius Tiberius and Aelia Constantina, eternal Augusts and Emperors, 
to be obliged and keep to the the force of this emancipation entirely, and to never go against it or a part of it. 
<milestone unit="line" n="29"/> If any of my heirs at any occasion or time dare to approach this emancipation, he will pay for the transgression ... ounces of gold … when he demands by action and force, 
and not less is this document always unbroken and unshaken. …
And having been asked the formal question to my face, I agreed that this is so to the limits that I will act, give, do and keep.
