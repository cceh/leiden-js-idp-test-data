               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ Isidorus to his brother Aurelius, many greetings. I told you about the two acanthus trees, that they were to give them to us; let them be dug round today. Let Phanias himself have them dug round. If he refuses, write to let me know. I shall perhaps come tomorrow for the sealing; so make haste with this in order that I may know. As to the bulls, make them work; don’t allow them to be entirely idle. Carry all the branches into the road and have them tied together by threes and dragged along. You will find this of service. Don’t make over anything to their masters. I shall perhaps give him nothing. I am causing them much trouble (?). Don’t allow the carpenters to be altogether idle; worry them. I pray for your health.
