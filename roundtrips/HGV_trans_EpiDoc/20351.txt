              Diogenes to his brother Didymas, greeting. I went to Achillas and inquired about you and he said “He is at Psobthis”. So knowing your goodness I write to you that you may assist Apis, who is collecting the revenues of Takona, and may show him hospitality, so that on his return he may bear witness of it to me. Good-bye.
