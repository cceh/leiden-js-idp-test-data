              Nicanor to Ninnarus his brother, greeting. Knowing your goodness to all, I ask you now to do me this one service, Please demand from Tithoïs the sailor a garment consisting of a brown tunic, inside which was a linen cloth, a worn towel, and some wool. All these were inside the brown tunic, and it was sealed with white clay, and with it send back to me all the other garments, making the total number six, to the Oxyrhynchite nome whence I obtained all the aforesaid articles. I write therefore to you, brother, to see if they are in some one else’s possession. Please tell me at once about this. I pray for your health. (Addressed) To Ninnarus steward of Apion, strategus(?), from Nicanor.
