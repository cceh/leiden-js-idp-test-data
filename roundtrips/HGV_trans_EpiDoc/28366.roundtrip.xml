              Greeting, Calocaerus: I, Cyrillus, address you. I was not so unfeeling as to leave you without reason; for though a man gets his interest in Tubi tenfold, he still does not recover his capital. I am going up with the dancer; even if he were not going I should not have broken my word. Farewell. (Addressed) Deliver to Calocaerus.
