              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 8</note>
              Since the nurse of the lord Sophronius is owed rent by Pstheious son of Phutos who cultivated her land, allow no one to touch what is left at his threshing-floor or the green crops until she has received her rent in full, I have to direct this letter to you, and if I learn that any one has taken any thing of his, I shall demand from you personally all that is owed her by him. (Addressed) Deliver to John, assistant, from Eudaemon.
