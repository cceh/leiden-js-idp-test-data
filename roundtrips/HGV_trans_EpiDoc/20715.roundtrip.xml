               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> To Valerius Ammonianus, also called Gerontius, logistes of the Oxyrhynchite nome, from the guild of carpenters of the illustrious and most illustrious city of Oxyrhynchus, through me, Aurelius Irenaeus, son of Apelles, the monthly president. I was sent by your grace owing to a communication received by you from Aurelius Palises, accountant of the repairs now being auspiciously carried out in the public warm baths, to examine a single persea tree which is in the city, and to make a report upon it to you in writing. I accordingly examined the persea tree and found that it had been barren for many years, and was quite dried up and unable to produce any more fruit, which facts I therefore report.
