              Theonas to Tetheus his lady mother, many greetings: I would have you know that the reason why I have been such a long time without sending you a letter is that I am in camp, and not that I am ill; so do not grieve about me. I was much grieved to hear that you had heard about me, for I was not seriously ill; and I blame the person who told you. Do not trouble to send me anything. I received the presents from Heraclides, Dionytas my brother brought me the present, and I received your letter. I give thanks to (the gods) ... continually, ... (Postscript) Do not burden yourself to send me anything. ... (Addressed) From Theonas to Tetheus...
