              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 7*/
              Philoxenus to Apa Martyrius, elder. On receipt of this my letter hasten to give heed to the new pond which is being made by the help of God in the priestsâ€™ estate, for I am about to take an oath of them as to the expense, what they have spent upon it. Good-bye.
