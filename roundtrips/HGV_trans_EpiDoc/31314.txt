              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 7*/
              Helene to her brother Petechon, greeting. You did not do well not to come on account of your brother; you have allowed his burial to be neglected. Know then that a strange woman is made his heir. Go to Theon and tell him about his cellar, that it has been sealed up although he owes nothing; and say to Petechon the son of Polydeuces, “Come if you are coming, for Dioscorus is labouring on you behalf. If you know that you are not coming, send me your brother Castor.” I pray for your health.
              I also, your father Alexander, send you many salutations. Buy me a little fish from the sea and send it bya man...
