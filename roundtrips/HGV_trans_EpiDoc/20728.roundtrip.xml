               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> Since Theon, son of Pausiris, has through the strategus of the nome served me with a copy of a memorandum which he has wrongfully executed in the record office, and by the terms of which he claimed payment for old debts alleged to be owing to him from Sarapion the maternal grandfather of my son Sarapion, who is under age, and the elder Sarapion’s brother Dionysius, I make the requisite counter-statement, as follows. I suspect that the security set up by Theon for the loan has become void owing to lapse of time and because Sarapion lived on for two years after the loan was concluded, and after his death his daughter Eubulia, who became my wife and the mother of Sarapion the minor, likewise lived on for eleven years, and since her death another five years elapsed without Theon having dared to bring forward his claim. Moreover Eubulia in her lifetime sold to Dionysius, the aforesaid brother of the elder Sarapion, property which had belonged to Sarapion for the sum of six talents of silver with the further stipulation that Dionysius should repay Sarapion’s creditors the debts owed to them; and though Theon was Sarapion’s creditor for other sums, he has received from Dionysius payment for these claims without making any reference to the claim which he now brings forward. I therefore beg you to give instructions that a letter be sent to the strategus of the Oxyrhynchite nome requesting him to serve Theon with a copy of this memorandum, that he may know that the writ which he unjustifiably served upon me has been invalidated, together with any additions I may make if he presents counter-statements; judgement against him being entered in my favour on those points on which it ought to be so entered, since I am ready to abide by the present memorandum, as is right (?).
