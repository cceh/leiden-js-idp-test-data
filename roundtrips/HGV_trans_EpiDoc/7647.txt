                  ((1)) To Kleon, greetings, (from) the foremen of the free stonecutters. We are being wronged. 
For what was agreed by Apollonios the dioiketes, nothing (of it) comes to us. ((4)) Diotimos has the written agreement. 
Do your best as to make sure that (supplies) are given to us by Dionysios and Diotimos in accordance with what we have contracted for, 
so that the work will not be left undone as has happened before. ((8)) If the men who are working find out that we have not received anything, 
they will pawn their iron (tools)! Year 30, Pachons 19.
