               ((1)) ‘ To Gaius Arrius Priscus, chief of police, from S … son of Pa …, a cultivator of public land, of
Euhemeria in the division of Themistes. On the 1st of the present month Pauni of the 20th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus there were thievishly stolen from me by certain individuals 2 loads of wheat-sheaves, out of those which I have on the public lands cultivated by me in the area of the village near the farmstead called that of the Winepress. Wherefore I request you to write that an inquiry be made into the matter. Farewell.’
