                  ((1)) Nikias to Apollonios, greetings. You wrote to Lysimachos about the trees so that [mostly illegible word]. Yet Lysimachos happened to be in Alexandria, and after leading the men who came around the garden I explained that on our land it is not possible nor is it usual for there to be offsets – nor were they unaware of this – but that we send for them from the Arsinoite island, for there through labor [...] water was always at hand, and I thought it right to send one of your men to Lysimachos, for it was possible for them to get the offsets from the low-regions, but they said that it was sufficient for them if they could bring trees to their plantation from the ones which were available on our land. So I gave them whatever ones they wanted, an itemized list of which I have appended. Farewell. Year 28, Athyr 25. Chian fig-trees, wooly fig-trees, Lydian fig-trees, mild fig-trees, red fig-trees, fruit-bearing fig-trees; pipless pomegranate trees; spring-time apple-trees, and those which bear fruit twice a year; and vines with smoke-colored grapes, Cilician vines, Mendaian vines, Eudamideian vines, Maroneian vines, pumpkin-seed (?) vines, Phoenician vines, vines with smoke-colored grapes, Alexandrian vines, Boumastian vines, […]ermulian vines, Drimian vines.
