                  ((1)) ‘Bubalus to Zenon, greeting. You wrote me to request Phanias the secretary of the cavalrymen to provide supplies at Meia for the cavalrymen who are going down to the Penteteris. You must know, then, that Leon who has been here said that a certain person has taken up the meat contract, paying the rent to the Treasury, and he will provide supplies; likewise also the oil-dealers who have contracted for the sale in retail will provide oil; so that nothing will be lacking. As for the billets, I have in fact been pointing them out to Meliton and his companions. I have therefore written to let you know. Farewell. Year 35, Pauni 26.
