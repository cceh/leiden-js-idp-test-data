Imperator, son of the divine Augustus, that I have indeed honestly and truthfully submitted the
return of the men and women who live with me and with my brother, and that no one else, neither
Roman nor freedman nor Alexandrian nor anyone else, lives with me and with my brother except for
the above-written, and that I have not lied in any respect. If I observe the oath, may it be well with
me, but if I swear falsely, the reverse. Year 20 of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Pachon (1?).
