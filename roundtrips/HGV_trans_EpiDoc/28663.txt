               ((1)) Ptolemais to her brother Papirianus, greetings.
               ((3)) Talbaeis – as you instructed her about the house – she goes out and does
                      what she wants, even if I tell her, “stay still!” ((6)) ... was unable ... And so I write to
                      you, sir, so that you know ... since (?) you went upcountry. ((9)) As you instructed
                      me about the money, “from which ... the wife of Pasion,” I collected one artaba
                      from her. ((12)) She said to me, “when your brother comes down, I’ll give the other
                      one as well.” ((14)) Zoilas did not give me money (?) for the bricks. He says, “they’re
                      not dry,” and I went off to Onesimos. ((17)) He did not find him: he’s with you in the
                      city. Until today Talbaeis is out. ((19)) If I say to her, “... here,” she takes no account
                      of me and ... ((21)) I was intending to drive her to the metropolis to you, (but) I
                      couldn’t get her under my sway (?).
             ((23)) I pray that you are well, brother.
