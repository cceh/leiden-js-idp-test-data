               ((1)) Ammonios to Hermaiskos,
                     the most honoured, greetings.
                     I have received your ostracon in which
                     you inform me, that they (?) did not expend much coal
                     in the stomoterion while you
                     and Apollinarios the centurion were present yesterday, nor
                     has there been fitting of stomoma today.
              ((8)) So give some more (?) points to be fitted with stomoma today
                     which is the 4th. Tomorrow I shall come down,
                     even if all the points
                     have not yet been fitted with stomoma. You write
                     to me to take from Lampon
                     an artaba of wheat and send it to you.
            ((14)) Send me a sack which can contain one (artaba)
                     and it will be
                     brought down with me.
                     And write me back about whatever else you want.
                     Be well.
