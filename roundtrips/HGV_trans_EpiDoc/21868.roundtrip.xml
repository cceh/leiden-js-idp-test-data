<milestone unit="line" n="1" rend="break"/> …[Laws long ago have been made], most eminent prefect, which empower women who are adorned with the right of three children <milestone unit="line" n="5"/> to be mistresses of themselves and act without a guardian in whatever business they transact, especially those who know how to write. <milestone unit="line" n="10"/> Accordingly, as I too enjoy the happy honour of being blessed with children and as I am a literate woman able to write with a high degree of ease, <milestone unit="line" n="15"/> it is with abundant security that I appeal to your highness by this my application with the object of being enabled to accomplish without hindrance whatever business I <milestone unit="line" n="20"/> henceforth transact, and I beg you to keep it without prejudice to my rights in your eminence’s office, in order that I may <milestone unit="line" n="25"/> obtain your support and acknowledge my unfailing gratitude. Farewell. I, Aurelia Thaisous also called Lolliane, have sent this for presentation. Year 10, Epeiph 21. <milestone unit="line" n="30" rend="break"/> <note>Annotation</note> Your application shall be kept in the [office].
