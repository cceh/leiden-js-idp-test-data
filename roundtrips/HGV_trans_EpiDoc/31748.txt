              Greeting, my holy son Demetrianus! I, Sotas, salute you. Our common ... is plain, and our common salvation (is secure ?); for these are the objects of Divine providence. If then you have decided in accordance with ancient custom to give the arura to the place, see that it is separated, so that they may use it; and however you may decide about the work be of good cheer. Salute all who are in your house. I pray to God for your continual good health in every respect. (Addressed) To my holy son Demetrianus from Sotas.
