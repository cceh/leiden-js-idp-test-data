              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 8</note>
              Your fraternal, illustrious learnedness ought to have helped my insignificance and not have allowed me to be so far undone, and not only not to injure me and my insignificant property, but to prevent others who wish to do so. I have said this because my cultivators at Amoules have been put to such straits, and because of some camels worth a score of denarii. If we go to litigation and your fraternal wisdom says that the guard did this, you control the guard and you ought to help me rather than to proceed against me and then leave the whole matter to my insignificance. God knows, I too could have injured an estate near Murmux belonging to the mistress of that guard, as I did on another occasion in the time of the honourable comes Paul, when I was injured once before by the inhabitants of Teruthis. Let me tell you then what you should do; be persuaded, whether they made an error or whether they did not, to have them released, so that I may not come to that or to other steps which might cause us vexation. I write this with due reverence. (Addressed) To my master the most illustrious, most wise, worthy of all reverence, my dearest brother the most illustrious advocate, from Victor, by the grace of God, advocate.
