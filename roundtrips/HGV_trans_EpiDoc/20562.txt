              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 2*/
              Chaereas to his dearest Tyrannus, many greetings. Write out immediately the list of arrears both of corn and money for the twelfth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, as Severus has given me instructions for demanding their payment. I have already written to you to be firm and demand payment until I come in peace. Do not therefore neglect this, but prepare the statements of corn and money from the ... year to the eleventh for the presentation of the demands. Good-bye.
