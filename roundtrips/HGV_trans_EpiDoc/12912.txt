               ((1)) ‘… from Onnophris son of ... of Euhemeria in the division of Themistes, farmer on the estate of Julia
Augusta of lands formerly the property of Gaius Julius Alexander. In the present month ... of the
15th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Demas son of Psaesis dwelling in the so-called Dromeus-farmstead in the area of the village, let his sheep and cattle into my mother's fields which I cultivate, whereby they grazed down 2 arurae of young wheat belonging to me and ½ arura of barley, by which I suffered no slight loss. The accused is pasturing with Harpaesis son of Heras. Wherefore I request that the accused may be brought before you for the consequent punishment. Farewell.
‘Onnophris, aged 50 years, with a scar on the little finger of his left hand.’
