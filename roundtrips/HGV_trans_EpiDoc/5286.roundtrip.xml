                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To . . . chief of the guards, from Tereus daughter of . . ., inhabitant of Hermopolis. In the 26th year Teteharma√Øs daughter of Theotnachthis, inhabitant of Hermopolis, met me in the square of Hermes by the court there, and attacking me in consequence of a dispute gave me many blows with her hands on every part of my body, and it was the fifth month that I was with child. The blows caused me to be laid up with sickness and my life is endangered. I inform you in order that Teteharmais be brought up and secured until my case be ascertained in the appointed period, so that if anything happens to me, she may be treated according to the enactments concerning such conduct, and if I survive, I may obtain satisfaction from her as is right. Farewell. The 26th year, Phaophi 18.
