               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ In the consulship of Flavius Ursus and Flavius Polemius, the most illustrious. To Flavius Eusebius, logistes of the Oxyrhynchite nome, from Aurelius Papnouthis, son of PauÌˆmis, ... of Oxyrhynchus, pilot of a public rowing vessel carrying 700 artabae, through me Helena, his wife. It is the custom that a single boatman should be provided from the city to serve on the said state vessel. I have several times requested Eustochius ... of the tribe which is at present responsible for this duty, to provide a boatman for the current year who shall help in the service of the public corn-supply. But he puts it off day after day and has not provided a man; and for this reason I send this petition, requesting your grace to send for him and compel him nevertheless to assign me a boatman... In the consulship above-written, Pharmouthi 2. I, Aurelia Helena, have presented this petition. I, Aurelius Theon, signed for her, as she is illiterate.
