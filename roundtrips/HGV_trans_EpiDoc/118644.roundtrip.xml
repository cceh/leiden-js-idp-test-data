               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Tiberius Claudius Pasion, strategus, from Dius son of Peteuris, of those from the city of the Oxyrhynchi, of 
the weavers of the quarter of Poimenike. Ammonius, the ex-praktor, extorted from me in Year 6 of Tiberius Claudius Caesar
Augustus Germanicus Imperator 40 drachmas of silver, and in Year 7,
 another 40 drachmas of silver, bit by bit. As a consequence, because of the extortion, I am in arrears for the trade tax for Year 7. I therefore request
 that you deal with (this) as you may see fit. Farewell. (J. Whitehorne)
