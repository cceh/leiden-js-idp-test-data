              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 10*/
              ... son of ..esis, ... of Oxyrhynchus in the Hippodrome quarter, to Secundus, collector of taxes of the same quarter. I swear by Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator that I will appear before the strategus Apollonius at the next reckoning of taxes unprotected by any temple, altar, sacred enclosure, or any place of sanctuary or shelter in any form. If I observe the oath may it be well with me, but if I swear falsely, the reverse. The sixth year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, the ninth of the month Neus Sebastus.
