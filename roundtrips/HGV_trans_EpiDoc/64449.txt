                  (Translation: P. L. Bat. 25.17) 
(((1)))Aurelius Dionysius son of Ch..., from the most illustrious city of Alexandria, living in the village Meameris of the city of the Naucratites, to Aurelius Gounthos, son of Ammon, from the same village, greetings. I acknowledge through this document of security of mine having received and counted out from you from your house by hand for my personal and pressing need a hundred myriads of minted Imperial silver, at an interest of fifty denarii for every one myriad, which I shall pay you every month without delay and without any dispute whatsoever, while it is not possible for me to say that I have given you anything without a written receipt; you having the right of execution against myself and all my possessions as if based on a judge’s decision. The document [will be valid].
