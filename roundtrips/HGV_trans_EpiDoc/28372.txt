              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 3*/
              Heraclides to his dearest Hatres, greeting. You ought without my writing to you to have sent me by SaeÌˆtas the 20 drachmae, for you know that I paid them here to my partners; but you have waited all this time without paying me. Be sure therefore to give this sum at once to the bearer of this letter, that you may save me too from trouble. Mind that you do not fail and thereby cause me to come to you and dispute with you about it; for indeed I found you at Paomis the other day and wanted to welcome you; but you would not stay, being oppressed by an evil conscience.
