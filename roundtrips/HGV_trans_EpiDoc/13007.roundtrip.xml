I, Diogas son of Demetrius son of Maron, my mother being ..., of the metropolis, registered in the quarter of Dionysius’ District, having been presented by you to the office of guard in the metropolis, swear by the fortune of Antoninus Caesar the lord that I will of necessity obey the strategus of the divisions of Themistes and Polemon, Onomastus, from the present day until the 5th intercalary day of the present 20th year of Antoninus Caesar the lord, receiving from you for the whole period of 10 months the sum agreed upon between us, 180 drachmae of silver, and you shall pay me every second month the instalment of 36 drachmae. Nothing is owing to me for the current period. I will perform all the duties pertaining to the office of a guard blamelessly, the responsibility, if anything occurs by my neglect, resting on my private property; otherwise may I be held responsible for the consequences of my oath. Written by Ammonias, scribe of the nome ; Diogas, professing to be illiterate, is aged about 35 years, with a scar on the left cheek and the left calf.’ Date.
