               ((1)) ‘Evander son of Ptolemaeus, priest of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, from Penneis son of Naaraus of
Euhemeria in the division of Themistes. On the 17th of the present month Neus Sebastus of the 20th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Onnophris son of Onnophris making an attack upon the dam (?) called that of Taorbelles, built at the expense of no small sums of money, ventured to pull it partly down, whereby there is a danger of its being entirely carried away and the fields beneath it, which are not few, being left unsown. Therefore I entreat you to deal with the matter. Farewell.’
