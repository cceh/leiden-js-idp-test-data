               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> To Julius Domitius, military tribune of the legion, from Aurelius Archelaus, his beneficiarius, greeting. I have previously recommended to you my friend Theon, and now I beg once more, sir, that you will regard him as if he were myself. He is indeed a man worthy of your affection. He left friends, property and business, and followed me, and he has throughout secured my comfort. I ask you therefore to grant him admittance to your house; he will be able to relate to you all that we have done. Whatever he tells you about me you may take as a fact....
