              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 6*/
              Serenus to Diogenes his brother, greeting. With the assistance of heaven our sister has taken a turn for the better, and our brother Harpocration is safe and well; for our ancestral gods continually assist us, granting us health and safety. I intended to come up myself on the [.]th, since Sarapionâ€™s friends said that he was ill. I write to you therefore to ask you to write to me at once(?) about him by any messenger you may have. The transport of the bundles will be performed immediately by my father: he has already taken away those in the 1[.] arourae. Many salutations to my sweetest brother Harpocration, Theanous, Theon, Diogenes, and Heliodorus. Many salutations to you all from Hieraciaena and her daughter Tsenesis: I pray for the health of you and all the household.
