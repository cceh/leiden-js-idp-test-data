               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Aurelius Sarapion, son of Georgios the late physician, of the mother Sophia, date-seller, hailing from the village of Isidoros (Isidorou Epoikion) of the Hermopolite nome, 
<milestone unit="line" n="4"/> and residing for a long time here in this fair Antinoopolis, to Aurelia Mariam, daughter of Phoibammon the farmer, from the mother Eirene, 
hailing from the village of Mounkrekis of the Antaiopolite nome, and residing here in the same city, greetings. 
<milestone unit="line" n="10"/> Since long ago I entered a legitimate marriage with you and shared life, believing I would spend my life with you in peaceful marriage, 
right now I do not know how malicious ill-will having been shed between us separated us from each other from this shared cohabitation, 
<milestone unit="line" n="17"/> for this reason I, the aforementioned Sarapion, your once husband and presently cut off from living with you, 
acknowledge that I have henceforth no claim against you for any matter whatsoever, written or unwritten, 
<milestone unit="line" n="22"/> adjudicated or not, neither with regards to the union of marriage and its expenses and the bridal gifts, nor concerning the baby born to us â€¦
