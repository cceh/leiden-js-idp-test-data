              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 2</note>
              To the agoranomi ... from Bacche, citizen, daughter of Hermon, with her guardian Diognetus, son of Dionysius, of the Epiphanean deme. I swear by the Emperor Caesar Vespasianus Augustus that I have sold to Heliodora, daughter of Heliodora, with her guardian who is her husband Apollonius, son of Dionysius, son of Dionysius also called Didymus, the slave Sarapous who belongs to me, and is about eight years old and without blemish apart from epilepsy and leprosy; and I swear that she is my property and is not mortgaged, and has not been alienated to other persons in any respect, and that I have received the price, 640 silver drachmae, and will guarantee the contract. If I swear truly, may it be well with me, but if falsely, the reverse.
