              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 2</note>
              To Tiberius Claudius Pasion, strategus, from Sarapion, son of Theon, a weaver of the city of Oxyrhynchus, living in Gymnasium square quarter. Apollophanes, ex-collector of the trade tax upon weavers, in the first year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator using great violence seized from me a linen tunic which I was wearing, worth 8 drachmae. He also extorted from me four more drachmae, and two drachmae each month during the six months from the month Neos Sebastos in the ninth year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator to Pharmuthi; total, 24 drachmae. I therefore beg you to proceed against him as you may think fit.
