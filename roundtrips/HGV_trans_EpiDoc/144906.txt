               ((1)) Numerius to his most honoured brother Longinus, many greetings. Whatever you give to Doras
                      who brings the ostracon, consider that you are giving it to me. ((7)) As for the bags, do not worry, since
                      I bring them tomorrow or the day after tomorrow at the latest. But if the caravan comes by, expect
                      me there. Farewell, most honoured.
