               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ ... as, centurion ... to Syrus, acting strategus, greeting. As soon as you receive my letter send the heirs of Apollonius, magistrate of the toparchy of ThmoisaphoÌ‚s, in order that there may be no fraud in the lading through any neglect of yours. I have sent for this purpose not only the officer of the guard but also the other councillors, so that we may be able to do the lading quickly at any point I may require.
