              public physician. <milestone unit="line" n="5" rend="break"/>I was today instructed by you, through Heraclides your assistant, 
              to inspect the body of a man who had been found hanged, named Hierax, and to report to you my opinion upon it. 
              <milestone unit="line" n="11"/>I therefore inspected the body in the presence of the aforesaid Heraclides at the house of Epagathus, 
              son of ...merus, son of Sarapion, in the Broad Street quarter, and found it hanged by a noose, which fact I accordingly report.
