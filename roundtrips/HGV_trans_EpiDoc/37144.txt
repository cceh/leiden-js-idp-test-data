               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ I have received what your magnificence sent me through your slave Justus, namely twenty jars of wine, twenty sprigs of dates, three jars of honey, and three of rose-water (?), five pans of bread, one pot of biscuit; and I pray for long life and happiness for your magnificence and your generous house. Since your magnificenceâ€™s obedient servants and their children are ill, I hope your highness will excuse my account. May your highness be pleased to send me a round pot of raphanus oil. Your highness has no longer shown care for the caparisoned colt (?), and the slave of your magnificence, Macarius.
               Present this to my master; John, the all-magnificent comes and my patron, from Theophilus, citizen.
