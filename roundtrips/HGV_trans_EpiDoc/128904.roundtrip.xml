. . . Ammonas. As I told you about Cepotes (or: the gardener?), “he has beans”, and you told
me that “I am sending Heras to give you that”, now, look, he did not come, if not write to him, so
that it gets given to me—I will knock off 5 artabas of grain in respect of the rent. How many times
have I written to you “send me the iron tools” and you did not send them! Even now immediately
send them to me because I need them, and papyrus rolls of 20 sheets. I pray for your good health . . .
