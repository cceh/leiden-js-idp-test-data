               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> Trene to Taonnophris and Philo. I have given to Calocaerus for Dionysius 340 drachmae, as he wrote to me to give him whatever he wanted. So please give this money to our workman Parammon, and if he requires anything further give him whatever he wants and send him off quickly. I send you by Calocaerus in my portmanteau a measure of dates from Ombos and twenty-five pomegranates, under seal. Please send me back in it two drachmasâ€™ weight of purgative, of which I am in urgent need. I send you by the said Calocaerus a box of grapes...and a basket of good dates under seal. Farewell. Athyr 30.
