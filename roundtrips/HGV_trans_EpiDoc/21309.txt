                  ((1)) Apollonius to Sarapion the strategus and gymnasiarch, many greetings
                         and continual good health. Isidorus, the bearer of this letter, is a member
                         of my household. Please consider him introduced to you, and if he approaches
                         you for anything, do it for him on my account. If you do this, I
                         shall be obliged to you. ((10)) And signify anything you choose, and I will
                         recompense you without hesitation. Look after you health. Farewell.
                         Dated in the 36th year of Caesar, Phaophi 26.
