              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 6*/
              To Valerius Ammonianus also called Gerontius, logistes of the Oxyrhynchite nome, from the Aurelii Heron son of ... and Didymus son of Dioscorus, both of the illustrious and most illustrious city of Oxyrhynchus, public physicians. We were sent by you to-day, Pharmouthi 6, in consequence of a petition delivered to you by Apollonius, officer of Aurelius Antonius governor of Aegyptus Herculia, to go to the house in the said city and inspect this person, and to make a written report upon the condition in which we found him. Having therefore proceeded thither we saw the man himself lying on a bed seized with a slight ... fever; which we accordingly report. /*Date and signature of the two physicians.*/
