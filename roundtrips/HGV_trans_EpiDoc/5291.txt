               ((1)) Harnesis son of Sentheus and his sons Sentheus and Onnophris, all three inhabitants of Setrempaei, and Eubius son of Pnepheros to Harmiusis son of Psempnoutis, herdsman at Euhemeria, greeting. We have received from you the price of the hay from the seventeen sown arurae of revenue-land cultivated by us in the area of Setrempaei which your sheep have grazed down, and we make no further claim against you. Didymus, public scribe, has written for them at their request because they are illiterate. Date.
