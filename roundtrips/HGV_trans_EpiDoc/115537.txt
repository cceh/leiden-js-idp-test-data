               ((1))… letter from my lord today ….. I sent people with three(?) nomismata – so here are nomismata 
of earnest-money (?)/as down payment. The rest of four [nomismata for four …….]. If not %for four%, 
I do not want three – I will supply [the remaining one] nomisma. And if (you? he?) wish/wishes 
(maybe: to sell four for three sol.), I will take the rest of the four nomismata. And I hope he will not 
have trouble finding your necessity (or: what you need) in the other (i.e., next) two days. 
For I gave up. I believe that such a need appeared. And the day before yesterday two were sold, 
each for two and a half nomismata, to Psennouris (or rather: in Psennouris?). With the messenger I sent 
koriaxoi, nine salted and five fresh. I greet very much the worthy footsteps of my lord.
