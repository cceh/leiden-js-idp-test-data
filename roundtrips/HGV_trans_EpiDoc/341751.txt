                  ((1)) Adrastos to his father Theon, greetings. You will do well, when you are in Antinoou Polis with Sarapion, to meet also Rufus, the prefect's friend.
((6)) For he willingly promised to help you in whatever is needed; do not hesitate, however, to use your own capacity in order to achieve everything;
for the journey to Antinoou Polis does not take you many days. ((13)) I asked Sarapion to help you in order to get on my behalf two mantles and a double cloak, 
all of them white, which in any case should be (â€¦) for me before the upstream delivery.
(((18))) Let there be no hindrance on any account either by your hesitation - for Sarapion will help - or because of the price of the woof: at whatever price,
let it be bought; and the money I shall pay here to his father. I pray that you be well, my respected father Theon.
