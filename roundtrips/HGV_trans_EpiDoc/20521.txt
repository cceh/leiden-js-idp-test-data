              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 2*/
              To Didymus and..., topogrammateis and komogrammateis, from Thamounion, daughter of Onnophris, of the city of Oxyrhynchus, with her guardian Sarapion, son of Sarapion. My son Thoönis, son of Dionysius, who has no trade, registered in the quarter of Temouenouthis, some time ago removed abroad. Wherefore I ask that his name be entered in the list of persons removed, henceforth from this year which is the 4th of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator; and I swear by Tiberius Claudius, etc., that the aforesaid statement is correct, and that Thoönis possesses no means... If I swear truly may it be well with me, but if falsely the reverse. Farewell.
              /*Signature of Thamounion, written by her guardian, date, and official description of Thamounion’s age and appearance.*/
