In the month of Pachon of the 20th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, as I was talking to Ancherimphis and his wife Thenapunchis, a door-keeper of Euhemeria in the division of Themistes, concerning the tin cups and … and other utensils and the 6o dr. of silver which they thievishly carried off from my house, he subjected me to no common outrage. I entreat you therefore to write to the archephodus of the village to bring them before you for the ensuing punishment. Farewell.
