                   <milestone unit="line" n="1"/>Herennius to Satornilus his dearest, greetings. <milestone unit="line" n="2"/>I certainly received your ostrakon.
Concerning the cats, Ourses is taking care of them in accordance with what 1 also wrote you on another occasion. 
And now look again, what do you think about the roses for 200 dr. and 180 dr., inquiring also the transport costs. 
<milestone unit="line" n="8"/>If your she-donkey has got better, come by night, so that you may go down to get the transport money.
Do not be concerned about your wood. If you find a good tree-trunk [by the finger?], I'll take it. 
<milestone unit="line" n="14"/>I sold... not having anywhere to put it (?)... Don't worry ...
