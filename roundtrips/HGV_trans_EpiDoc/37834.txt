              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 8*/
              Kommon son of Taur... to Paulus son of (?) Sillagr... brother of Narroous, Pachon 23. The people of P... have come and informed me that certain neighbours have again attacked them and ventured to [carry off ...] and other objects belonging to the people of the said village. Go to the said village and preserve their inviolability, and if any persons attempt to do any lawless action to them or even to contemplate it, instruct their leaders to abstain from any such outrage. For if they persist, a troop of soldiers will come on them and seize and hand them over to a tribunal to be punished for the lawlessness upon which they may venture. (Subscribed) Read by me. Read by me, the scribe. /*Address on the verso.*/
