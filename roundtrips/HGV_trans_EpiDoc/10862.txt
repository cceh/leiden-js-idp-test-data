               ((2)) To Dionysius and Theon, ex-gymnasiarchs, ((3)) keepers of the property registers
                      of the Arsinoite nome, ((4)) from Apia, daughter of Heras, son of ((5)) Heraclas, of the village
               ((6)) of Theadelphia in the division of Themistes, under ((7)) the wardship of her sister Tanepheros’
               ((8)) son Teos, son of Sambas. ((9)) Of the property which is registered in my name, namely
                      the half ((10)) and the tenth part, being common and ((11)) undivided, of a house and court
                      formerly ((12)) owned by Theon, also called Socrates, son of Heron, ((13)) and the whole tenement
                      in a lodging-house in the said ((14)) village of Theadelphia, I wish to alienate ((15)) the fifth
                      part of the whole ((16)) house and court and of the whole ((17)) tenement to Socrates, son of
                      Didas, son of Sambas, ((18)) of (the quarter of) the Bithynians of Ision ... ((19)) at the price
                      of 200 drachmae of silver. I therefore give notice, ((20)) in order that instructions may
                      be sent to the director of the ((21)) record office of Theadelphia, duly to join me in the transaction
                      of the business.
