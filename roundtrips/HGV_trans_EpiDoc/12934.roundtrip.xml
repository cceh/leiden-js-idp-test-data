               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> ‘To Gaius Julius Pholus, chief of police, from Chaeremon son of Acusilaus, superintendent of the parts of the estates of Gaius Caesar Imperator Augustus and Tiberius Claudius Germanicus lying in the area of Euhemeria in the division of Themistes. On the night before the 18th of Pachon of the present 4th year of Gaius Caesar Imperator Augustus certain individuals broke thievishly into a store of anise which I have on the catoecic lands and threshed out 20 loads, amounting to 10 artabae of anise; whereby I have suffered no slight damage. I therefore beg you to write to the archephodus that he may make an inquiry into the matter and send the guilty parties to you. Farewell. (Signed) I, Chaeremon son of Acusilaus, have presented the aforesaid petition.’ Date.
