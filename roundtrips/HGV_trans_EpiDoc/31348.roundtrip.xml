               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> From ......s Gaianus. Greeting, my good brother Agenor! I received at once about the day of the Saturnalia what you dispatched to me. I should have sent to you myself more quickly if I had had more soldiers with me; but... went back and we cannot catch a single animal. I send for your use....
               I pray, my dear brother, for your lasting health and prosperity.
