               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ Trene to Taonnophris and Philo, good cheer! I was as much grieved and shed as many tears over Eumoerus as I shed for Didymas, and I did everything that was fitting, and so did all my friends, Epaphroditus and Thermouthion and Philion and Apollonius and Plantas. But still there is nothing one can do in the face of such trouble. So I leave you to comfort yourselves. Goodbye. Athyr 1.
