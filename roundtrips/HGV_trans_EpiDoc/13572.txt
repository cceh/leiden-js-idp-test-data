to Protas, son of Nephersos, about sixty eight years old, with a scar on the little finger of his 
left hand, that she has received from Protas cash ((10)) one hundred and twelve drachmas of silver 
and the parapherna, (but) that she cedes the pherne, which they still owe the same Tepheros, 
daughter of Apeis, because she has received the above mentioned sum of money in 
accordance with a deed [of cession], which was perfected through the same notary office in 
the twenty first year of deified Hadrian in the month Mesore, which (deed) ((15)) Tepheros has also 
handed over to Protas, equally that she shall not lay any claims to him about any matter 
whatsoever nor about the dowry gifts, equally that she shall not proceed against Protas about 
an unbuilt area in Tebtynis estimated at sixty (drachmas), for which Chiales had himself 
appointed guardian at Tepherosâ€™ request (?), in accordance with a written deed ((20)) of cession,

for her.

acknowledge that I have received  from Protas, son of Nephersos, hundred and twelve 
drachmas of silver and the parapherna, that I (cede) the ((25)) pherne which they owe me 
according to a contract, since/after that she has married in the twenty first year of deified 
Hadrian, after Dionysos, son of Nephersos, himself had finished his life and that I shall not 
proceed against Protas about any matter whatsoever nor about [the unbuilt area] for which 
Chiales, son of Collouthos, had himself appointed guardian of Tepheros, daughter of 
Apeis - - - (((33))) Ciales and Tepheros.
