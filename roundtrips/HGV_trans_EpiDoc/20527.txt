Wherefore, coming forward for his selection, I declare that my father Diogenes, son of Theogenes, son of Philiscus, his mother being SinthooÌˆnis, daughter of Achilleus, was selected at the selection which took place in the 5th year of the deified Vespasian under Sutorius Sotas, ex-strategus, ... ex-basilicogrammateus, and the other proper Officials in the said quarter, in accordance with the proofs produced by him that his father Theogenes, son of Philiscus, was entered as the grandson of a gymnasiarch in the list of those from the gymnasium made in the 34th year of the deified Caesar, among the persons who have no amphodarch; that I myself was placed among the unselected owing to non-residence; that my mother Ptolema married my father before the 7th year of Nero and was registered by him in the house-to-house census of the following 8th year as the daughter of Philiscus, son of Philiscus, ex-gymnasiarch of the said city; that my wife and the mother of my son, Isidora, married me in the 7th year of Nero, and that ber father Ptolemaeus, son of Ammonius... had likewise been selected in the same year (i.e. the 7th of Nero) and in the same Heracles-place quarter, in accordance with the proofs produced by him that his father Ammonius, son of Ptolemaeus, was (included) in the list of the 34th year of the deified Caesar in the same quarter.
