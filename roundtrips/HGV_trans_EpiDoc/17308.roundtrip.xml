Make haste, therefore, to spend all the Italian silver that you have on purchases, on my behalf, of goods of every description at whatever price you find them. For this purpose I have dispatched an officialis to you. But take notice that should you intend to indulge in any malpractices I shall not allow you to do so. I pray, my brother, that you may be in long health.
