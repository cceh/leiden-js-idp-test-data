                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> From Ammonius to Demetria, his mother, and Dius, his father, greetings. 
The letter of my brother Theon should have been enough, in which he informed you that, 
having got a chill deep within <milestone unit="line" n="5"/> and a general weakness of the body, which made us all 
worry greatly, he immediately recovered, thanks to the gods, and was in perfect form again, 
so that he even bathed on that very same day, and no residue of his illness still <milestone unit="line" n="10"/> remains. 
I swear to all the gods that these things <del>that I am sending you</del> are very true. In order that 
. . . you would . . . that he sent his letter to you just to please you, I have also written. 
However, in order that you 〈do not〉 hear about this from one of those people who have 
the habit of not telling the truth, I thought it necessary to let you know of this before they 
did. . . . <milestone unit="line" n="15"/> <del>Therefore, do not be upset, since Theon, my brother, is in perfect condition 
and carries out all his usual activities.</del> Your daughter and my brother Sotas send you their 
greetings. Give my best to Ptolemaeus and Antiochus, my brothers.  <milestone unit="line" n="20"/> I wish you good 
health, my most honoured (parents), and good fortune to the entire household . . . I swear 
that my bother Theon is very well and doing his usual activities.
