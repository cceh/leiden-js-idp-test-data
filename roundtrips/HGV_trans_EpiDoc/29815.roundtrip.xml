               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/>Antigonus to Marion his brother, greetings. I send you, through Calpurnius (?) our co-citizen, the cibariator, Rutilius' contract (cheirograph). I ask you, brother, as I asked you when you (were) in Egypt, to demand from him what he owes you. I know that you are fierce, so he will not ridicule you with words. He suspects that the note is yours. You will say, as is your right, how old the contract (cheirograph) is and that he has not paid up. Farewell.
