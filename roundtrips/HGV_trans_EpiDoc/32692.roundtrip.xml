                 <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Kopres to his sister Sarapias, very many greetings. Before all
                        else, I pray for your good health before the Lor(d) G(o)d. <milestone unit="line" n="6"/> I
                        want you to know that we arrived on the 11th and it became
                        known to us that people presenting themselves in court are
                        being made to sacrifice and I made a power-of-attorney in favour
                        of my brother <milestone unit="line" n="13"/> and so far we have accomplished nothing, but we
                        instructed an advocate on the 12th (?), so that the case about
                        the land could be brought in on the 14th. <milestone unit="line" n="20"/> If in the event that
                        we accomplish anything, I’ll write to you. I’ve sent you nothing
                        since I found Theodoros himself setting out. I’ll send them
                        to you by another hand soon. <milestone unit="line" n="27"/> Write to us about the health of
                        all of you and how Maximina has been and Asena. And if it’s
                        possible let him (her?) come with your mother
               </p>

               <p>
                  <milestone unit="line" n="32"/> so that his (her?)
                           leukoma can be cured, because I’ve seen others cured myself.
                           I pray that you are well; my best wishes to all our friends by name. Del(iver) to my sister, f(rom) Kopr(es) 99.
