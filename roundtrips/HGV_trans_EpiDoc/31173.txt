                  ((1)) ‘Dioscorus to his sister Eus, many greetings. First of all I pray to all the gods that I may receive you in good health. When you wrote to me concerning your sister that we should present a petition, I forthwith learned from Eutychianus that one had been presented and have done nothing further in the matter. Slaves are very dear here and it is inexpedient to buy. We have not even found here a cloak for Eupsephia; for everything has risen in price, and I told Hatres of this ... I pray for your long health.
