               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ [After the date and the usual opening formula the papyrus proceeds (l. 13):] Having lately had occasion to require an axle for the appliance belonging to the landlord under my charge which is called by the name of Gedius Anianus and supplies water to arable land, I went up to the city and asked your magnificence to order the axle to be provided for me. Whereupon your magnificence with due regard for the state of your property credited me in my accounts with the value of a new, proper, serviceable, and satisfactory axle, which I have received as the complement of all the machinery this fifteenth day of Tybi of the present second indiction for the water-supply of the crops of the third indiction by Godâ€™s help approaching. This axle is to serve the purposes of irrigation for a term of seven years, and the old one has been given to the porter.
