              Aristandrus to his son Apion, greeting. Theon our son is coming to you on his way to the city of Nikias on account of a pressing incompleted negotiation of which you have perhaps been aware long since from his father; I think that he wrote to you about it while he was stil alive. Indeed you love him both for his own sake and for his fatherâ€™s memory. But I know that this letter of mine also will be of much help to him, if he wants anything either with Apion the basilicogrammateus of the Prosopite nome or with any one else, if you will ask them and not delay to write to them. I pray for your perpetual health and prosperity, my son. (Addressed) To my son Apion, basilicogrammateus of the Letopolite nome, from Aristandrus of Oxyrhynchus.
