of the present] eleventh indiction [...] and that he has paid [fully] the rental for them of the
eleventh indiction to his admirableness. <milestone unit="line" n="12"/> The lease is already [effective?]. As to the titles of
the previous owners, I handed them over to him, since I have sold, as you know, the above-mentioned
arouras to him and [in answer to the formal questions, he has given his assent]. I, Serenus
son of Theodorus agree.
