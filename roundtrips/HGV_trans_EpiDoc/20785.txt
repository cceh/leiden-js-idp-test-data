               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ I have received from your magnificence through John your most distinguished banker for the revenues of the third instalment of the thirteenth indiction 1440 gold solidi in pure coin and 720 solidi in independent (?) Egyptian coin according to the standard of Alexandria, with 45 solidi to make up the deficiency in purity, total 2205 gold solidi. This sum I am prepared to take to Alexandria, apart from accidents sent by Heaven and dangers and mischances by river, and to pay it to John and Simeonius the most illustrious money-changers and to bring a written receipt from the most illustrious agent Theodorus to the effect that the aforesaid sum has been paid in full. For your security or that of the said most distinguished banker I have drawn up the present acknowledgement of deposit written with my own hand this 26th day of Athyr, 14th indiction.
