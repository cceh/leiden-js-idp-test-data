              To my most esteemed and virtuous mother, the lady Maria, from your son Peter in the Lord God, greeting. I have found a good opportunity by this letter to greet you many times with my brother Theon and my sister the lady Plusia and my sweetest brethren Hera√Øs, Nonna, Omaia, and Phoebammon, by name. Be pleased, my lady mother, to send me the ... and the rings. Do not neglect to send them to me by Athanasius. Many greetings to my lord brother Athanasius the valet of Abel and also of Dorotheus; many greetings to my mother Cyrillous. I pray for your long health. Be pleased, my lady mother, to buy me a thick veil for the winter, and to get the Oasis hood from Peter son of Esour, that I may wear it when 1 come. (Addressed) Deliver to my dearest Maria from your son Peter.
