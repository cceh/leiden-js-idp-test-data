              Isidorus to his son Demetrius, greeting. Give your brother Ammonianus the colt to be brought to me and the salt of ammonia, both the pounded and the unpounded, and the basil-seed, in order that I may doctor him away here, for I have been asked by my father Posidonius to stay for the collection during these five days; and send to me about anything you need, I pray for your lasting health.
