                  ((1)) To my dear sister Sophrone, greetings, Dios.
                         Above all I pray to [the lord] god that you are doing well
                         and also that the best things in life may be yours.
                  ((4)) I am wondering why until today
                         you did not send us a single letter,
                         although every day there are many
                         acquaintances who are traveling north. Yet now,
                         please, write back to us about your
                         and our father’s wellbeing. ((9)) We
                         are glad to be here. I will tell you everything
                         that has happened to me in Alexandria.
                         So, when we arrived here, we didn’t find
                         the person whom we came looking for
                         (but) we did find our lord the emperor visiting.
                         He ordered that athletes be brought
                         to the Campus and fortunately, I
                         and the other five were selected, without the other athletes knowing.
                ((18)) When I arrived there, I was at first paired up to do pankration
                         and I had bad luck, as I do not know how to do pankration.
                         So I was performing [poorly] for a long time
                         […] falling. The god was about to
                         […] I challenged the five to do pammachon.
                         The emperor wanted to know whether
                         I was [immediately] summoned to do it one man after the other.
                ((25)) When I saw that [those who fell] were collecting
                         dung from the contest, I challenged them for the pammachon.
                         The prize for us was a linen tunic and hundred
                         guilders. The [linen tunic] is inexpensive, and
                         I received […] and I made […] debtors (?) and
                         I got a gold coin with the money and the other five
                         the tunic. This happened on the 2?th of Choiak. ((31)) And on the 26th
                         of the same month he held the festival in the Lageion and
                         we performed there. And I got a silver prize, a sleeveless tunic,
                         and the money. So don’t be sad that we haven’t found the
                         person, for good fortune has given us other things. ((35)) Take care
                         of your sister […] God willing, we will come to meet you after Mecheir,
                         making you happy. Your […] sends you many greetings.
                         I greet my dear father and all
                         who love my soul.
                         I pray that you are well, my dear sister,
                         for many years.
