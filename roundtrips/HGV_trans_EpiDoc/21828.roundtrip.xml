              ... has not yet been presented. Asclepiades, strategus,after consideration said, “It appears to be necessary that the accounts should first be presented, in order that it may be ascertained what has been left, what there is over, and what debts have been paid. I will then decide about the allowances, and, if there is anything required, judgement shall be given. Heradion said, I will present the accounts immediately; but it is not my fault that they have not been presented. Agathinus too, however, must join in presenting them, and until judgement is given I will not undertake the post (?) of guardian myself or in combination with Agathinus. The strategus ordered the whole amount to be accounted for. Read by me.”
