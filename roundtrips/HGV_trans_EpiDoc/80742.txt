                  ((1)) . . . the condition of the adscripticius. And he shall on no account leave the same village nor transfer to another place, but if he is 
required of me by your glory through your subordinates on any day, for any reason whatsoever, ((5)) I shall bring him forward and deliver him up in a 
public place without recourse to any place of refuge or letter of safe-conduct, in the place where I have also received him, in the public prison of the 
same city of the Oxyrhynchites. Or if I fail to do this, I acknowledge that I shall pay for his non-appearance twelve solidi of gold, actual payment of 
which is to be enforced. This deed of surety, written in a single copy, is binding, and in reply to the formal question I gave my assent. (2nd hand) I, 
Aurelius ((10)) Phoebammon, comarch, son of Pieus, the aforewritten, have made this surety and undertake responsibility for the same Macarius 
at my risk, as aforesaid. I, Anastasius, contract writer, wrote on his behalf, as requested, because he is illiterate.
(((13))) Through me, Anastasius, the completion was made.
