                        <=‘A piece of ship (?) timber, 28 cubits; width from the roots 16 fingers, from the foliage 12 fingers; thickness from the roots 8 fingers, from the foliage 6 fingers. Find [how big?] is the timber. I do it this way: I add the width, 16 and 12, the result is 28, half of which is 14. I add the thickness, 6 and 8, the result is 14, half of which is 7; (multiply) by 14, the result is 98; (multiply) by the length of 28 cubits, the result is 2,744. This I divide by 288 and the remainder into fingers, (divide by) 12, the result is 9 and 12 2/3 fingers. So it holds for similar cases..’=>
