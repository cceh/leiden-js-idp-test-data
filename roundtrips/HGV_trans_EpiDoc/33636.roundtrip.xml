              Sarmates to his own Dioscorus. I sent you by Ammon the priest a marium of oil, which is meant for you to burn, and by my brother Theodorus four baskets, which are for you to burn, and a ... of oil for you to uncover and eat, and a spathium of wine for you to drink at the festival, and by Ilis one basket for you to burn. If Theodorus reaches you there, come here with him and bring the milk cakes when you come and the ..., not the papyrus. I pray for your health. (Addressed) Deliver to my mother and father from Sarmates.
