               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Proclamation of Marcus Petronius Mamertinus, praefect of Egypt. <milestone unit="line" n="3"/> In a previous
                      edict I commanded that receipts should be mutually given with reference to debts
                      secured by documents, on account of the disputes concerning them which had occurred
                      during my office. <milestone unit="line" n="7"/> I now give orders generally with regard to all payments to the
                      government made in any manner either actual <milestone unit="line" n="9"/> or by credit, whether in kind or in
                      money or in bodily labour or any other way whatsoever, <milestone unit="line" n="12"/> that payer and payee shall
                      mutually give receipts; <milestone unit="line" n="14"/> and I will punish any one who acts in any other manner than
                      that hereby directed. <milestone unit="line" n="15"/> Since moreover the complaint has been made by debtors that
                      though they present their accounts to their creditors, <milestone unit="line" n="18"/> the latter are unwilling to accept
                      payment from them in order that they may be induced by the fear of incurring penalties
                      to buy off the delay, <milestone unit="line" n="22"/> those who are thus prevented from paying shall be allowed
                      to give evidence concerning the refusal to give up the bond, so that the creditors
                      may pay the fitting penalty for their disobedience. <milestone unit="line" n="26"/> Date.
