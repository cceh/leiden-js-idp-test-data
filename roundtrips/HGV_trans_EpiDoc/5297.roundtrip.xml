               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> ‘To Asclepiades, king’s cousin and strategus from Protomachus son of Harmais, embalmer of the Labyrinth. An investigation is pending at my instance before the officer appointed over us against Philoumene and her son Maron concerning a claim to property, possession of which rests with me and my wife Thermouthis; and we are picking up trouble from these two who are forever calling busy-bodies into consultation, and others too contrary to the published ordinance. Therefore I request you to give orders to write to the epistates to summon the case-hunting busybodies into your presence that I may obtain my just rights and they the penalty consequent on the ordinance. Farewell.’
(Docketed) ‘To the epistates: Summon them. Year 35 Mecheir 19.’
