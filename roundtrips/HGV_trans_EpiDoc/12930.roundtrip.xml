of the present month Pauni of the and year of Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, having gone to Euhemeria in the division of Themistes on some unfinished business, I entered into conversation with Onnophris son of Silbon, an inhabitant of the village, concerning a pledge I have against him, whereupon he opposing me made a brutal and odious attack upon me and subjected me to much shameful mishandling, and in the struggle I lost a writing tablet and 60 silver drachmae. Moreover he had the audacity to bring baseless accusations of malice against me. Wherefore I ask you to write that he may be brought before you for fitting punishment. Farewell.’
