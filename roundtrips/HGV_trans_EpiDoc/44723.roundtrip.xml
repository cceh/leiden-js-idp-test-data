               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Dioskourides, hêgemôn and phrourarchos, from Dioskourides, son of Pakemis, of those from the ship of Nikadas. 
On the [ --- ] of the present month, Pachon, when I was going into my house, Horos, my younger brother, leapt out and jumped me. 
He mistreated me, beating me with very many blows on my face and all over my body, with the result that I am in dire peril of losing my sight. 
Wherefore, I ask that you, summoning him, examine him and see to it that he meets with the fitting punishment. Farewell.
