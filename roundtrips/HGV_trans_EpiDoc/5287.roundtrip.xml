On the 9th of Mesore of the 18th and 3rd year, Harmiusis son of Psempnoutis having let his sheep loose on the cnecus which we have together with the chaff in the drying-place, grazed away 15 artabae of it and obliged us to present this petition in order that you may compel him to restore to us the aforesaid 15 artabae of cnecus, so that the rents suffer no loss and he himself may receive the penalties which he deserves. Farewell.’
