                  ((1)) (Pataecion) to Zenon, greeting. I assigned to the possession of Aristodemus a house of Sokeus son of Nechauis, a native soldier, in Aueris, and I have heard that he has sailed down to present a petition to Apollonius about me, ignoring both the seller and the buyer, with the idea that he will discomfit me if he appeals to Apollonius. If, therefore, you have an opportunity and if it be practicable, will you please take action against the fellow, in order that I might not be discredited by the rest of them. I have written also to Apollonius the interpreter requesting him also to do the man as much damage as he can. Farewell. Year 36, Pharmouthi I.
