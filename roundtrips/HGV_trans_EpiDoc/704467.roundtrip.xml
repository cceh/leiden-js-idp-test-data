                       including the quintana. Write me a letter to give me guardianship so that I have power to negotiate about her.
                <milestone unit="line" n="7"/> And if you have a chiton send it to her since hers was mislaid (as she arrived here,) so she had to put on something
                       of mine. And write to me through whom I can send you the money. Greet Arrianos. Farewell.
