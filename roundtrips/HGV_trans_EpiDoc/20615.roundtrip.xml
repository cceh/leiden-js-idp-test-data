              From Demetrous daughter of Amois son of Philoxenus, with her guardian her son Amois son of Aperos. I wish that Horus, the son of my aforesaid son Amois and Heraclous daughter of Harbaithus, who in the present 20th year of Antoninus Caesar the lord is 8 years of age, should henceforth be registered at the house of which I own part in the quarter of the Square of Thoëris. I therefore duly present this memorandum.
              <note>Date, and signatures of Demetrous and Amois written for them by Hermon.</note>
