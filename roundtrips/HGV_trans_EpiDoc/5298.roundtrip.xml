               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> ’29. To Zopyrus, epimeletes, from Judas son of Dositheus, Jew. I am farmer of 3 arourae of dry ground near Philadelphia at the preexisting rental and an annual special fee of 4 artabae of wheat per aroura. This I have effected with great distress and expense, and have completed the annual payments for rent satisfactorily up to the 23rd year. But now Marres the village scribe has entered me, contrary to what is right, for the amount of 5½ artabae of wheat per aroura over and above the amount of the rent, though I have never paid this sum. Therefore I appeal to your clemency and request you, if you will, to write to the proper authority for accurate details to be submitted to you, so that if the facts are as I state them, you may take care that I do not have to pay any improper exaction, and I myself may obtain my just rights. Farewell.’
