               ((1)) Soumaios to Yonathes
                      son of Beianos and to
                      Masabala, greetings.
               ((4)) Since I have sent to
                      you Agrippa, hurry
                      to send me
                      wands and citrons,
                      as much as you will be able,
                      for the camp of the Jews,
                      and do not do otherwise.
             ((11)) It (scil. the letter) was written
                      in greek because of
                      our inability to write Jewish script. Release
                      him (i.e., Agrippa)
                      more quickly
                      on account of the festival,
                      and do not do otherwise.
             ((20)) (2nd hand) Soumaios, farewell.
