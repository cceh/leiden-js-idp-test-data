               ((1)) [...] I greet and salute my beloved, holy and God-loving fathers, men truly revered, (endued) with every good quality and every good thing. 
               ((10)) I greet you much, in all the fullness of my soul; moreover I cast myself down and worship the prints of your holy feet, men truly beloved, Apa Isaac and Apa Elias. 
               ((17)) It is written thus in the scripture, the breath of God: 'A city cannot be hid that is set upon a hill.' 
               ((24)) Ye in truth it is that (give forth) every good perfume and far hath it spread. 
               ((28)) Farewell.
