               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> In the consulship of Paulinus and Julianus, the most illustrious. To Flavius Leucadius, logistes of the Oxyrhynchite nome, from the Aurelii ...., Didymus and Silvanus, of the most illustrious city of Oxyrhynchus, public physicians. Your grace sent us in consequence of a petition received by you from Aurelius Dioscorus, son of Dorotheus, of Oxyrhynchus, to make a report in writing upon his daughter, who, as he complained, had been injured by the fall of his house which had occurred. We accordingly went to Dioscorusâ€™ house, and saw that the girl had several cuts in her hip and wounds near the shoulder and on the right knee. We therefore present this report.
