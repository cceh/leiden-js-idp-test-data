                  (((1))) Sarapammon to Achilleus and Severus, the most honoured, greetings. Before all I pray for
your health, and I make your obeisance before the ancestral gods. Please, my lords, since we stated
our case before the epistrategus regarding the house of the painter on the 14th of Phaophi of the
current 2nd(?) year, and we did not have enough time(?) to get the minutes (of the hearing), I beg you
without fail to excerpt them for me. The names are: Zois daughter of Zoilus and Thaesis daughter
of Zenarium and Tiberius Claudius . . .
