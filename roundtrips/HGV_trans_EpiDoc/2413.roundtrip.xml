Owing to Apollonius having written to me to meet him at Memphis on the 2nd I have been obliged to travel round the nome without any method, in order that I might be ready to sail up immediately. Please, then, write to me how many more days he is going to remain in the Mendesian nome and when he will sail up to Memphis, and tell me also directly where he has decided to celebrate the king’s birthday and on what day in the Egyptian calendar the sacrifice will take place, in order that I may know. Farewell. Year 29, Mecheir 17.
