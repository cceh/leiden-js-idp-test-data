               [Translation from P. Abinn.] To Flavius Abinnaeus, praefectus alae of the troops in the camp of Dionysias in the Arsinoite nome, from Aurelius Aboul son of Dionysius, of the village of Hermopolis in the same nome. ((5))My sheep were shorn in the night, eleven in number, by certain criminals, and on my investigating the shearing of the sheep I heard (it was) Paul the soldier, one of those under your command, and he named as his fellow evil-doers ((10))Peter son of Sarapion and his brother Melas a soldier and Apion son of Horion the irenarch from the same village. Wherefore I ask and beseech your humanity to apprehend these men and compel them â€¦ ((15))by these evildoers, and then to bring my statement to the knowledge of my lord the Duke ; for his function it is to take vengeance on the perpetrators of such outrages. And obtaining this I shall acknowledge my gratitude to you, Sir. Farewell. ((20))I Aurelius Aboul have made this statement. Consulship of our masters Constantinus [sic] for the 4th time and Constans for the 3rd time, Augusti, Epeiph 5. ((24)) P.S. On another occasion the same persons drove off pigs of mine to the number of 6.
