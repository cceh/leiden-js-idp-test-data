(((1))) To Maximus, priest, exegetes in office, and councilor, from Tabesammon, the daughter of Ammonius otherwise called Cassius, of Oxrhynchus, ((5)) her mother being Diophantis, a citizen. As I am borrowing for my pressing needs a sum of money at interest, amounting to six thousand drachmae, upon the security of property consisting of a piece of vine land and all its appurtenances ((10)) near the village of Oinaru, I make the request through you, being aware â€¦ that the ((15)) royal scribe, the acting strategus, is absent, that I may have assigned to me as my guardian for this transaction only Amoitas, son of Ploution and Demetrous, of the aforesaid city of ((20)) Oxyrhynchus, who is present and gives his consent. I have paid the appointed tax for making such a request. (Date, signatures)
