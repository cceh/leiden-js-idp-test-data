               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Aurelios Didymos strategus of the merides of Themistos and Polemon of the Arsinoite from Aurelios Pakysis son of Tesenouphis, 
priest and stolistes of the temple of the first rank of the village of Soknopaiou Nesos of the meris of Herakleides. 
<milestone unit="line" n="4"/> I possess a place in the house of the wife of my son Aurelios Tesenouphis in the hamlet of Pisa√Øs in the meris of Themistos in which I keep in storage foodstuffs for our daily use.
<milestone unit="line" n="8"/> Just lately my relatives went into the place because I myself was away in Alexandria and it was discovered that the foodstuffs had been pilfered. 
<milestone unit="line" n="11"/> The cause of the theft, as was clear, was that the crime had been committed when the place, which is on the upper floor, had been holed through the floor. 
<milestone unit="line" n="14"/> When those who are living there were proved to have done this through malice aforethought, they undertook in the presence of both the archephodos of the village and others to give me seven artabas of grain against the amount of the theft. 
<milestone unit="line" n="19"/> But since they have agreed to the undertaking but up until now have not complied with the restitution, of necessity I am making submission of a petition which I request be placed on record, 
so that my rights be secured for me against the accused, Panouphis son of Stotoetis and Pakysis son of Kanneis. Farewell. <milestone unit="line" n="26" rend="break"/> (2nd hand) I, Aureliou (sic) Pakysis, have submitted the petition. 
<milestone unit="line" n="27" rend="break"/> (1st hand) Year 24 of Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Parthicus Maximus Britannicus Maximus Germanicus Maximus Pius Augustus, Pharmouthi 12.
