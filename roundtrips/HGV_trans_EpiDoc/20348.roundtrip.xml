              From Ptoleminus to Thonius, steward of Nigrus, greeting. Measure out to my brother Dorotheus, who is about to collect payments on my account, hitherto paid (?) through Hieronicus, for the price of 500 pounds of meat, forty artabae of aracus, total 40 art. aracus, a single artaba being reckoned at one hundred and eighty myriads of denarii, making the order seven thousand two hundred myriads of denarii, total 7,200 myriads of denarii. <note>Signature and date. Endorsed on the verso ‘There is one God: aracus, Phaophi’.</note>
