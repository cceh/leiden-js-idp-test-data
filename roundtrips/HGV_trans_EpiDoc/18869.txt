               <= Teos to Onnophris, his father, very many greetings. I received word that the centurion in Akoris has sent (5) for the hieroglyphics carvers. Therefore if you know that it is true, send me word, whether we should go up or remain. I therefore ask (you) to send me a reply soon. And about the priests (10) …. Greet my brothers …. Farewell. …. 16th of the month Domitianus.
