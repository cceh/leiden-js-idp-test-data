                      the hands of Herakleides and belong to the 2000 silver drachmae granted by Herakleides’
                      deceased mother, Thaubarion, daughter of Mysthes, to Kastor’s mother Apollonarion,
                      daughter of Lysimachos, by a deed of syngraphodiatheke registered at the record-office

                      and Lysimachos also called Gaion, his brothers from the same mother, both sons of
                      Lysimachos, in favour of the father of Kastor and his brothers Dioskoros also called

                      of Tubi, 2nd day, concerning the 2000 drachmae which they owe him; ((22)) and the order of
                      payment just concerning the 1204 silver drachmae which have been in the hands of
                      Herakleides, as appears from the aforesaid bond, is nullified, since Herakleides has also
                      paid back to the brothers of Kastor, Dioskoros also called Kastor and Lysimachos, the
                      parts due to them of the same 1204 drachmae, in conformity with the receipts which

                      representatives shall proceed against Herakleides or his representatives neither on account
                      of the sum received as aforesaid nor of the interests of that sum nor of the interests which
                      Kastor’s father Kronion received when Kastor was still a minor, from former times up to
                      the present day. ((33)) (Subscriptions of Kastor and Herakleides. Docket of the record-office
