               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Dionysodorus, strategus of the Arsinoite noma, from Mysthes and Pelopion both sons of Pelops, of Euhemeria in the division of Themistes. 
<milestone unit="line" n="7"/> On the 16th of Phamenoth of the present 17th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, as I was making an inspection of the lands which we farm belonging to 
Marcus Aponius Saturninus in the area of the aforesaid village, <milestone unit="line" n="16"/> we found that the young wheat and the barley which we have on the farm had been grazed down 
by the sheep of Harmiusis son of Heras, herdsman, Aunes son of Minches being witness to it; <milestone unit="line" n="26" rend="break"/> the consequent damage amounts to five artabae of wheat and nine artabae of barley. 
I therefore request that he be brought before you for the ensuing punishment. Farewell.
