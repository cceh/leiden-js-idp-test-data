              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 10</note>
              The year after the consulship of Julius Constantius, patrician, brother of our master Constantinus Augustus, and Rufius Albinus, the most illustrious. To Flavius Paranius also called Macrobius, logistes of the Oxyrhynchite nome, from Aurelius Thonius son of Demetrius, of the same city, priest of the temple of Zeus, Hera, and the associated most great gods, celebrant of the divine images and their advancing victory. Your grace enjoined me to state in writing whence I obtained the aforesaid rank. Accordingly I acknowledge, swearing the holy, divine oath by our masters the Emperor and the Caesars, that I received the said rank in succession to my aforesaid father Demetrius, who was himself one of the said priests and celebrants of the divine images, and that I have made no false statement, under penalty of the consequences of the divine oath. In the consulate aforesaid, Phamenoth 30. I, Aurelius Thonius, have sworn the divine oath, as aforesaid.
