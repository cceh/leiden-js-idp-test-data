              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 12</note>
              To my lord brother Apollonius Nilus, greeting. First of all I pray for your prosperity before the Lord God. By every means, brother, give my brother Zakaon the confectioner about forty talents on my account, and let me know if I am to pay the equivalent amount where you are, and you shall have it, since ..., as he could not bring it with him. Pray do not neglect this, brother, for you know my debt (?) in that quarter. I pray for your continued health, my lord. (Addressed) To my lord brother Apollonius from Nilus.
