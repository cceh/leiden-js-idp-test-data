I acknowledge that I have received from you and have been paid in full the four gold solidi less 600 myriads due for the price of the produce of the said village, and I have no claim upon you in respect of this, and I make and will make no charge against you; and since your bond has been lost and cannot be found I declare that it is null and [void] both for me and every one producing it, and I have issued this receipt for your security and in answer to the question have given my consent. <note>Signatures of Aurelius John, written for him by Aurelius Theodore, and of the scribe, and title on the verso.</note>
