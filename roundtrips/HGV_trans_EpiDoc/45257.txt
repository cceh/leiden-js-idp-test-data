            <=Nemesianus to Severus, greetings.
                The winetaster has declared the Euboean wine to be unsuitable; so from this send up two hundred and fifty keramia with the boatman Harachthes. (2nd hand) Farewell and send up the two hundred and fifty keramia of wine, that is 250 keramia 30 Pachon of the 7th year. (S.A. Stephens)
