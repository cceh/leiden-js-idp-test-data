               ((1)) …of Phnebieus, the… to the meridarchês, contrary to your hatred of wrongdoing, and contemplating these things (?) at the same time, 
on the 22nd of Pachon Menandros and Demetrios, son of Thales, with the cooperation of the archephodos, Sosibios, and Petechon, 
theagos, not only broke down the door, but even set upon my mother, who tried to talk to them about these actions. 
They treated her with an extremely immoderate amount of hubris and put her in danger of her life, and then violently removed my dovecote 
before departing. I ask, if it seems best, that you please stand these men before you and deal with them in keeping with your hatred of wrongdoing, 
so that they attempt nothing violent in the future, but meet with the punishments appropriate for committing violence against others, 
and so that I may receive aid. Farewell.
