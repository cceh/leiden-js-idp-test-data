And that it is possible for each [of them] to dispose [his own] things as ((25)) he or she chooses, and (it is possible) for Thenstotoetis to join herself in marriage again, to [whatever] man she wishes, not [being] open to accusation from Lysas. And that they will not bring charges against each other [about] any aspect of the things connected with the marriage nor about any matter in general ((30)) up to the present day.
