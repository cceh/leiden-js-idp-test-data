the petition presented to me by Hermodorus son of Cornelius, with my signature, together with the documents 
brought to me by the secretaries, in order that, if the debts are paid, the ensuing remission of the lands 
be effected, but only if nothing is still due to the Treasury. <milestone unit="line" n="7"/>I write this as the deputy of the most high 
Proculus in his visit to Egypt. I pray for your health. <milestone unit="line" n="9"/>Date.
