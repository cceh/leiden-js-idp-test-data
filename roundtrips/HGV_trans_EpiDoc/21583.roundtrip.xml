               [Translation from P. Oxy. 9] To Sarapas, comogrammateus, from Anteis son of Ammonius son of Anteis, his mother being Tapeëis, of the village of Teïs. <milestone unit="line" n="5"/>My father Ammonas son of Anteis son of Heracleus, his mother being Tanetbeus, and his full brother Anteis, who were past age, <milestone unit="line" n="10"/>had no trade, and were registered in the said village of Teïs, died in the past twelfth year of Antoninus Caesar the lord after <milestone unit="line" n="15"/>the presentation of the accounts. I therefore request that they be registered in the list of dead persons through the <milestone unit="line" n="20"/>public accounts presented by you, and I swear by the Emperor Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius that the above declaration <milestone unit="line" n="25"/>is true and that I have made no false statement, otherwise let me be liable to the consequences of the oath. (Date and signature of Anteis written for him by Theon son of Ammonius.)
