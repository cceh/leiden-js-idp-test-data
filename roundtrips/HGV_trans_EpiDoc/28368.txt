              Serenus to his beloved sister Isidora, many greetings. Before all else I pray for your health, and every day and evening I perform the act of veneration on your behalf to Thderis who loves you. I assure you that ever since you left me I have been in mourning, weeping by night and lamenting by day. Since we bathed together on Phaophi 12, I never bathed nor anointed myself until Athur 12. You sent me letters which would have shaken a stone, so much did your words move me. Instantly I answered you and gave the letter sealed (to the messenger) on the 12th, together with letters for you(?). Apart from your saying and writing “Colobus has made me a prostitute,” he (Colobus) said to me, “Your wife sent me a message saying ‘He himself (Serenus) has sold the chain and himself put me in the boat.’” You say this to prevent my being believed any longer with regard to my embarkation (?). See how many times I have sent to you! Whether you are coming or not, let me know. (Addressed) Deliver to Isidora from Serenus.
