              To Philiscus, farmer of the tax on weaving, from Sarapion, son of Sarapion. My slave Apollophanes a weaver, registered in Temgenouthis Square, died during absence in the present 7th year of Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator. Wherefore I request that his name be inscribed in the list of dead persons, and I swear by Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator that this information is true.
              <note>Date, and official signature of Philiscus.</note>
