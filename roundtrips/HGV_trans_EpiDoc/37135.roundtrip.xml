              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 6</note>
              We reached Nilopolis on the 13th about the 6th hour, and after we had released the animals a letter was delivered to us from your brotherly excellency about the 8th hour; and God knows whether we had not released the animals, and whether we had any more to unloose. Accordingly before three hours were passed, as soon as we could leave the city we leave it, being obliged by the help of God to arrive. We were much displeased with your brotherly excellency for not explaining to us any of the consequences. (Addressed) Deliver to the lord my most excellent, most illustrious, and most beloved brother Petronius, exceptor, from Timotheus, ordinarius of Theodotus.
