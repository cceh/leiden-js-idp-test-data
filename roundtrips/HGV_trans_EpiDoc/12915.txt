               ((1)) ‘To Dionysodorus, strategus of the Arsinoite nome, from Psosnaus son of Kesthorus, farmer of your own land. On the night before the 16th of Phamenoth of the 16th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus certain individuals made a thievish attack on the house belonging to me at Euhemeria, and having gained an entrance into the barn carried off five hundred bundles of my hay. I beg you therefore to make an inquiry and that the authors of the crime receive due punishment. Farewell.’
