               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> ‘From Heron son of Sar …, his mother being Tasoucharion daughter of …, of the metropolis, registered in the Linen-factories’ quarter. Whereas Heraclides my brother on both father’s and mother’s side has reached in the present 7th year of Antoninus and Verus the lords Augusti the age of 13 and ought to be selected, I append the claims of both of us. Our parents were returned in the successive household censuses up to the census of the 23rd year of the deified Aelius Antoninus in the aforesaid Linen-factories’ quarter, returning along with themselves in the census of the 9th year of the deified Aelius Antoninus myself, Heron, and in the census of the 33rd year my brother Heraclides also who is now a candidate for selection ; accordingly we present this petition.’ Signature of Heron and date.
