              In the consulship of our lords Licinius Augustus for the fifth time and Crispus the most illustrious Caesar for the first time. To Aurelius Heras also called Dionysius, praepositus of the eighth pagus of the Oxyrhynchite nome, from Aurelius Hatres son of Hieracion, tesserarius of the village of Dositheou in the pagus under your charge. I present at my own risk in relief of the donkey-driver at Pelusium in place of the one now there the person below written, who is a man of means and suitable for the duty, namely Aurelius Horus son of Pathotes, of the said village. In the consulship aforesaid, Pharmouthi 15. I, Aurelius Hatres, presented this. I, Aurelius Ammonas, wrote for him as he is illiterate.
