               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/>Keep (?) these (animals?) for two(?) days, until the brother comes and takes [them] back to the 
city (i.e., Herakleopolis). If possible, I ask you to bother to come to Herakleopolis, so that I can tell you 
[my] answer. And since the man I sent with two animals is a stranger – as he is Alexandrian – 
do not entrust him with them (sc. the animals), but send him off tomorrow.
