On the … th at the first hour I presented the letters to his excellency the epistrategus and he straightway gave them to his secretary. A little later, when I approached the secretary inquiring concerning the men who are with me, he answered :— “Go, the answer will be delivered through the strategi.” But when I again exhorted him and stated that I could not leave without an answer owing to the men with me and that the matter was urgent, I was told :— “I will to-morrow read it over to him myself so that he may state his reply.” I write therefore to you, my lord, that you may know, and (to inquire) whether you wish me to remain here with the men until either they are heard or I receive an answer. I pray for your good health, my lord. Mesore 12.’
