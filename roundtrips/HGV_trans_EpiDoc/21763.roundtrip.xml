              Zo√Øs to Ischyrion her brother, greeting. No one has brought me a letter about the bread, but if you send a letter by Colluthus, an artaba will come to you immediately. If you wish to depart for Alexandria, Apollos son of Theon is going tomorrow. Good-bye. The 17th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, the 29th of the month Neus Sebastus. (Addressed) To Ischyrion.
