              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 3</note>
              To Apolinarius, strategus, from Pausiris son of Petsiris, from the village of Sephtha, living at Nemera. Since Didymus son of Amois has delivered to me an accusation charging me with defrauding his son Didymus in connexion with some wheat, I request that a copy of this memorandum be served upon his aforesaid son Didymus in order that he may have a written notice and appear wherever his highness the praefect Avidius Heliodorus holds his auspicious court for the nome or administers justice, and that he may attend until the trial takes place so that the facts may be proved. The 22nd year of the Emperor Caesar Trajanus Hadrianus Augustus, Mecheir 3. I, Pausiris son of Petsiris, have presented this memorandum.
