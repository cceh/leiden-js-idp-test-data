                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Dionysios, tôn philôn and stratêgos, from Ptolemaios, son of Glaukias, Macedonian of those in katochê in the great Sarapieion, 
now for the tenth year. I am wronged by those sweeping and the bakers, those who are now performing service at the temple and 
who are going down into the Anoubieion, and (also) by Archebis, the doctor, and Mus, the cloak-seller, and others whose names I don’t know. 
For in year 19, on Phaophi 11, being present at the Astartieion, in which temple I am now in katochê, they broke in, wishing to strip and insult me, 
just as previously they attempted to get rid of me (?), in spite of the fact that I am a Greek. Since, therefore, I realize that they have lost all sense, 
I have shut myself in; but they, finding Harmais, my agent, upon the public walk, they beat him with bronze files. I ask, therefore, that you please 
write to Menedemos, your agent in the Anoubieion, to force them to do me justice; but if they do not obey, to send them to you, so that you 
may treat them in accordance with your hatred of wrongdoing. Farewell.
(in a fourth hand) To Menedemos. See to it that he receives justice. Year 19, Phaophi 19.
