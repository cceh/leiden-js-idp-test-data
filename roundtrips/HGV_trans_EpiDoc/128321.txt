               ((1))Aurelius Hatres son of Cornelius and Aurelius Didymus son of Anteros, both presidents of
the village of Thosbis, and Callinicus son of Apeis from the city of the Oxyrhynchi, the head of
an ergasterion of aulos-players and krotalistriai, mutually agree that on the one hand Hatres’ party has
invited Callinicus and the said company to perform for those who reside at the village, for five festive
days, beginning from the 13th of Phaophi until the 17th, including the 17th of the same month, at
the wage each day of one hundred and twenty drachmas and forty pairs of loaves and eight(?) kotylai
of radish-oil, (and for all the festive days(?)) one keramion of wine and one of vinegar, all free from
encumbrances. ((16))On the other hand, Hatres’ party has remitted on the spot to Callinicus . . . (for earnest
money?) twenty drachmas, and they will receive him with the company, act of God apart, from
(anywhere within) the Oxyrhynchite nome . . .  (M. Satama)
