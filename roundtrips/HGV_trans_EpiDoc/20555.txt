              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 2*/
              To Tiberius Claudius Pasion, strategus, from Alexandrus, son of Apollonius, a weaver of Oxyrhynchus, living in the quarter of the square of ThoeÌˆris. Apollophanes, ex-collector of taxes, in the eighth year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator extorted from me among other people 16 drachmae of silver. I therefore beg you to proceed against him as you may think fit.
