              Leon, presbyter, to the presbyters and deacons who share the local service, beloved brothers in the Lord God, fullness of joy. Our brother Ammonius, who is coming to you, receive in peace; through whom we and those with us greet you and those who are with you kindly in the Lord. I pray for your health in the Lord God. Emmanuel is my witness. Amen.
