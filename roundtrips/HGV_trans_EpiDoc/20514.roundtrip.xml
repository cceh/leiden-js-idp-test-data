              To Chaereas, strategus, from Heracleus, son of Apion, and Naris, son of Colluthus the elder. We return for the current 12th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus the sheep which we own as six each, or twelve sheep in all. They will pasture, together with the lambs that may be produced, in the neighbourhood of Pela in the western toparchy and throughout the nome, mixed with those of Dionysius, son of Hippalus, under Dionysiusâ€™ son, Strato the younger, as shepherd, who is registered as an inhabitant of the said Pela. We will also pay the proper tax upon them. Farewell.
              I, Sarapion, toparch, have set my signature to twelve sheep, total 12.
              The 12th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Mecheir 5.
