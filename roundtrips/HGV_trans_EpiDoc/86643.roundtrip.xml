               <milestone unit="line" n="10"/> I greet you much, in all the fullness of my soul; moreover I cast myself down and worship the prints of your holy feet, men truly beloved, Apa Isaac and Apa Elias. 
               <milestone unit="line" n="17"/> It is written thus in the scripture, the breath of God: 'A city cannot be hid that is set upon a hill.' 
               <milestone unit="line" n="24"/> Ye in truth it is that (give forth) every good perfume and far hath it spread. 
               <milestone unit="line" n="28"/> Farewell.
