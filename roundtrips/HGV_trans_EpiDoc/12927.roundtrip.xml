as I was talking to Papontos son of Orsenouphis and Apion called Kapareis, <milestone unit="line" n="15" rend="break"/> shepherds, concerning what they owe me as damages for grazing by their flocks, 
they belaboured me with blows, shamelessly refusing to pay, and I lost 40 silver drachmae which I had with me from the sale of opium, and my belt.
