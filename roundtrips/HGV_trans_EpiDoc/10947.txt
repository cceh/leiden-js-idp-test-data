               ((1)) Eleventh year of the Emperor Caesar Trajan Hadrian Augustus, sixteenth
                      of the month Kaisareios, in Theadelphia of the Themistos division of the
                      Arsinoite nome. ((6)) Demas son of Horeion, Persian of the epigonê, about
                      twenty-five years old, scar under his right shin, acknowledges to Horos
                      son of Panesneus, about twenty-eight years old, scar to the right of his
                      forehead, ((11)) that he has conceded to him for the coming twelfth year of the
                      lord Hadrian Caesar, ((14)) in the public lands that he cultivates near
                      Polydeukia in the so-called lands assigned, one aroura by measurement
                      from five arouras ((18)) from whichever direction Horos chooses, to sow vetchseed
                      together with the mustard that will be planted, Horos providing
                      seed and doing the sowing and weeding, ((23)) but all the agricultural work and
                      irrigation being the responsibility of the acknowledging party (= Demas);
             ((26)) and the same acknowledging party has received from Horos the rent in
                      advance and guarantees it with every guarantee. ((30)) If it happens that the
                      plain of the village is divided, Horos shall receive one aroura from
                      whatever arouras Demas is allotted, whether this allocation is near
                      Theadelphia or near Polydeukia ... (the papyrus breaks off ).
