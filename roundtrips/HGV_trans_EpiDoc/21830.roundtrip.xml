              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 12</note>
              To my lord and brother Heras Ammonius, centurion, greeting. Ph..., the bearer of my letter, is my tenant. He states that he has been appointed to a public office at the village of Dositheou, namely the collectorship of tunics and cloaks, but has not yet been entrusted with the collection. Accordingly use all your efforts, brother, to rescue him from the office, and also to give him your favourable consideration, thereby conferring a great favour upon me, and further not to allow in future the people of the village to injure him in other respects or appoint him to other offices, but let him testify to the benefits gained by your good will. I pray for your continued health, my lord and brother. (Addressed) To my lord and brother Heras from Ammonius, princeps.
