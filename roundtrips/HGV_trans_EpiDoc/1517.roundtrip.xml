               [Translation from Austin, Hellenistic World 1981] To Apollonius the dioiketes greetings from the farmers from [the] Heliopolite nome, from the village of Philadelphus in the Arsinoite nome, from your 10,000 aruras. After you gave us 1,000 [aruras] from the 10,000, and we had worked and sown these, Damis took away from us 200 (?) aruras, and when [we] objected, he arrested three of our elders until he compelled them to sign an act of renunciation. And though [we were] willing to vacate the 1,000 aruras and asked / him to allow us time to work and sow them, even then he would not agree, but allowed the land to remain unsown. And there is another scribe, an Egyptian, [one of the] wicked men, who does not allow the city to be settled but chases away those who are there. And there are many mistakes in the 10,000 aruras as there is nobody who knows anything about agriculture. We therefore urge you, if you think fit, to call some of us in and listen to what we want to tell you. For twenty days have elapsed since our arrival. [We] wish … we are unable to …, but have spent everything we had / when we arrived. Farewell.
