              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 12*/
              ... before I returned, thievishly carried off from the threshing-floor, which I own near Iseum Pekusios, as much as 4 artabae of wheat, and likewise from another threshing-floor, which I own near the same Iseum for the Crown-land cultivated by me, as much as 4 more artabae of wheat. I have suspicions against Sarapion, guard of the threshing-floors, and the others who sleep there. Wherefore having been wronged I appeal to you, and request you to give orders (to your subordinates) to search out the guilty persons and bring them before you, in order that I may recover the stolen property, and the persons who shall be proved guilty may receive due punishment, so as to prevent others, and that I may obtain relief. Farewell.
