              The voyage past the Antaeopolite nome is most troublesome; every day I am burdened on account of it and I am extremely worn out with the matter. If a gratuity must be given to the brother of the mother of Achillasâ€™ sons, please get some lotus (?) for him from Sarapion at my expense. Remember the night-festival of Isis at the Serapeum.
