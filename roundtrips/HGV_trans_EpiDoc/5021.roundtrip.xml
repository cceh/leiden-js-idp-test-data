               <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Herakleitos to Dorion, greetings. Make it your priority to seek out Ptolemaios, also known as Pasis, 
the man dragged out of the temple by the agents of Antipatros and Onnophris, son of Achogres, who has made an accusation of bia (against them). 
Stand him before us so that he may be sent to Philon, archiphylakitês, and the appropriate examination of the aforementioned events may take place.
And concerning Antipatros, son of Peritas, 100-aroura man, and Seuthes, son of Nikeratos, we have sent (them) to Philon so that he may make
explanation to Ptolemaios the stratêgos and via him they may be brought up. Farewell. Year 13, Hathyr....
