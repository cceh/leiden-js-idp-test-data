              Nemesianus to his brother Sarapammon, many greetings. You did well to send me the file, but you sent me one which is too fine. So I send it to you by Apollon with the pattern in order that you may go by that. You write to me in the letter “I send you a boy’s linen cloth”, and I have received nothing. Apollon told me, “He gave me nothing.” I send you the tripod by Apollon; and if you want anything reply to me by the said Apollon, so that I may send it you, and do your best to get me the file, and send it by Apollon; and look for a file which files not only wood but iron tools ... and indicate ... I pray for your lasting health.
