               /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 1*/ To Gnaeus Vergilius Capito, from Tryphon, son of Dionysius, of the city of Oxyrhynchus. Syrus, son of Syrus, entrusted to the keeping of my wife Saraeus, daughter of Apion, in the seventh year of Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator, on my security, a boy foundling named Heraclas, whom he had picked up from the gutter, to be nursed. The foundling died, and Syrus tried to carry off into slavery my infant son Apion. I accordingly applied to Pasion, the strategus of the nome, by whom my son Apion was restored to me in accordance with what you, my benefactor, had commanded, and the minutes entered by Pasion. Syrus, however, refuses to comply with the judgement, and hinders me in my trade. I therefore come to you, my preserver, in order to obtain my rights. Farewell.
