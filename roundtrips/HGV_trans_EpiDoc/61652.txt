              /*Translation: from P.Oxy. 8*/
              Fly, hateful spirit! Christ pursues. thee ; the Son of God and the Holy Spirit have outstripped thee. O God of the sheep-pool, deliver from every evil thy handmaid Joannia whom Anastasia also called Euphemia bare. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that hath been made. O Lord Christ, Son and Word of the living God, who healedst every sickness and every infirmity, heal and regard thy handmaid Joannia whom Anastasia also called Euphemia bare, chase from her and put to flight all fevers and every kind of chill, quotidian, tertian, and quartan, and every evil. Pray through the intercession of our lady the mother of God and the glorious archangels and Saint John, the glorious apostle and evangelist and divine, and Saint Serenus and Saint Philoxenus and Saint Victor and Saint Justus and all the Saints. Upon thy name, O Lord God, have I called, the wonderful and exceeding glorious name, the terror of thy foes. Amen.
