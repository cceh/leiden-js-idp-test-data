                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> Hermogenes, son of Phil[ --- ], Persian of the epigone, to king Ptolemy, greetings. I am wronged by Petosiris, 
the one who lives in Lagis of the Themistes meris of the Arsinoite nome. For in year 5, according to the financial calendar, 
Phamenoth 21, a disagreement having arisen between us in the aforementioned village, (he placed) his hands upon me… 
with beatings and stompings upon whatever part of my body he might strike, … those present. Therefore, I need you, king, 
to command Diophanes, stratêgos, to write to Agathokles, epistatês, and have him (i.e., Agathokles) send him (i.e., Petosiris) to Diophanes, 
so that he may be tried for me, and if the things I write prove to be true, he may be forced to pay 200 drachmas for the blows… 
Diophanes…. For if this occurs, I shall have found justice through you, king. Farewell.
(in a second hand) To Agathokles: By all means, settle their differences; but if you cannot, send (them).
