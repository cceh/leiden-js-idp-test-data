                  ((1)) To the archons being in charge in the 38th year
                         from Berenikê, daughter of Archagathos,
                         a Jewess of the (living) in Arphroditês Polis.
                  ((5)) In the year 37, month Phamenôth, Dêmêtrios
                         son of Philôtas, a Jew of the ones residing
                         in Peimpasbytis,
                         sent me a letter of oath
                         according to the ancestral law convening that
                         he would give me
                         in the month of Pauni of the same year
                         the agreed price of the slave-girl Roma
                         and the child of hers that he had bought for himself, (which is) 8 talents of copper coins.
                ((14)) (And he conveyed), should he not give me, he would pay
                         in the following month of Epeiph (the same amount)
                         plus the half of it (as damages) and to the royal treasury
                         78 silver drachmae as penalty, without any
                         judgment or litigation;
                ((19)) and that he would give on account of rent for the nurse
                         each month 2500 copper coins for clothing until the 15th of
                         Phamenôth and two artabaes of wheat
                         during 4 months
                         as well as 2 kotylai of oil each month, and from the month of Pauni on,
                         one artaba of wheat and 2 kotylai of oil.
                ((26)) And given that, notwithstanding all these and other (conditions)
                         contained in the letter, Philotas (i.e. Dêmêtrios)
                         has not paid anything until
                         now, but has breached the
                         ancestral law, wherefore I have been forced
                         to provide a proof of being away from home (because of this matter) and
                         having conveyed over to you another letter
                         of some of the Jews of Aphroditês Polis,
                ((34)) I request,
                         if it pleases you,
                         to command the hypêretês
                         to conduct Dêmêtrios here, and
                         once you have summoned him, to compel him
                         to pay and to recompense on the spot
                         the amount (plus) the half of it, which makes 12 talents and … 2500 drachmae (for the clothing)
                         and all the rest according to the oath; as far as the penalty to the royal treasury is concerned,
                         (I request) to treat the perjurer mercilessly.
