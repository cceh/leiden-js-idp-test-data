                  <milestone unit="line" n="1"/> To Zenon, greetings, Ammeneus, swineherd. Per your instructions to us for rearing the pigs for the festival of Arsinoe, 
having put my himation down as a pledge, I bought the pigs and reared them, so that you might not find fault with me. 
But as I was bringing them down, going off into the… 2 of our pigs were lost, and I found the man who had them; 
but he will return neither of them to us until you write to him, and by a crocodile… I did not take them away for myself… 
by those in the village that he may not take them (?). So write to them, and to Timotheos, so that no such thing may happen. 
And Se[..].s, concerning whom I gave you the petition, is not allowing me to graze the pigs. Farewell.

K…[.]pis, son of Psenpesos, kômarchês, 1 pig.
Aristoboulos, 1 pig; I pointed him out to the phylakitai.
And at night 1 pig was lost, concerning which I went to see the phylakitai, and they said that it was at Leukippos’ house.
