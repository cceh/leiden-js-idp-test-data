                         had a case against me which required the decision of the late praefect Flavius Titianus, the result being that
                         on presenting myself judgement was entered for the sum fixed on account of the summonses amounting to 500

                         case requires the exercise of your hatred of wrongdoers, I entreat you, my lord and just judge, to hear me
                         against them ...
