<milestone unit="line" n="1" rend="break"/> To Maximus, priest, exegetes in office, and councilor, from Tabesammon, the daughter of Ammonius otherwise called Cassius, of Oxrhynchus, <milestone unit="line" n="5"/> her mother being Diophantis, a citizen. As I am borrowing for my pressing needs a sum of money at interest, amounting to six thousand drachmae, upon the security of property consisting of a piece of vine land and all its appurtenances <milestone unit="line" n="10"/> near the village of Oinaru, I make the request through you, being aware â€¦ that the <milestone unit="line" n="15"/> royal scribe, the acting strategus, is absent, that I may have assigned to me as my guardian for this transaction only Amoitas, son of Ploution and Demetrous, of the aforesaid city of <milestone unit="line" n="20"/> Oxyrhynchus, who is present and gives his consent. I have paid the appointed tax for making such a request. (Date, signatures)
