                         happens to be related to the wife of Apollodotos. In their ignorance thereof, the men of
                         Tlepolemos have referred his possessions to the royal (treasury), and
                         in addition [number] drachmas are exacted for [number] years. Please take care that
                         they grant him a delay till the next harvest. Apollodotos too cares (about the matter),
                         so that I am convinced that you can manage.
               </p>
